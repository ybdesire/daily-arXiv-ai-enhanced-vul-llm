While extensive research has explored their theoretical benefits for communication and sensing, practical deployments in smart environments such as homes, vehicles, and industrial settings remain limited and under-examined, particularly from security and privacy perspectives. This survey provides a comprehensive examination of RIS applications in real-world systems, with a focus on the security and privacy threats, vulnerabilities, and defensive strategies relevant to practical use. We analyze scenarios with two types of systems (with and without legitimate RIS) and two types of attackers (with and without malicious RIS), and demonstrate how RIS may introduce new attacks to practical systems, including eavesdropping, jamming, and spoofing attacks. In response, we review defenses against RIS-related attacks in these systems, such as applying additional security algorithms, disrupting attackers, and early detection of unauthorized RIS. We also discuss scenarios in which the legitimate user applies an additional RIS to defend against attacks. To support future research, we also provide a collection of open-source tools, datasets, demos, and papers at: https://awesome-ris-security.github.io/.

This work investigates backdoor propagation in such emerging generative data supply chains, namely Data-Chain Backdoor (DCB). Specifically, we find that open-source diffusion models can become hidden carriers of backdoors. Their strong distribution-fitting ability causes them to memorize and reproduce backdoor triggers during generation, which are subsequently inherited by downstream models, resulting in severe security risks. This threat is particularly concerning under clean-label attack scenarios, as it remains effective while having negligible impact on the utility of the synthetic data. Furthermore, we discover an Early-Stage Trigger Manifestation (ESTM) phenomenon: backdoor trigger patterns tend to surface more explicitly in the early, high-noise stages of the diffusion model's reverse generation process before being subtly integrated into the final samples.

This paper introduces the Principle of Proportional Duty (PPD), a novel framework that models how ethical responsibility scales with an agent's epistemic state. The framework reveals that moral duty is not lost to uncertainty but transforms: as uncertainty increases, Action Duty (the duty to act decisively) is proportionally converted into Repair Duty (the active duty to verify, inquire, and resolve uncertainty).\n  This dynamic is expressed by the equation D_total = K[(1-HI) + HI * g(C_signal)], where Total Duty is a function of Knowledge (K), Humility/Uncertainty (HI), and Contextual Signal Strength (C_signal). Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that systems maintaining a baseline humility coefficient (lambda > 0) produce more stable duty allocations and reduce the risk of overconfident decision-making.\n  By formalizing humility as a system parameter, the PPD offers a mathematically tractable approach to moral responsibility that could inform the development of auditable AI decision systems. This paper applies the framework across four domains, clinical ethics, recipient-rights law, economic governance, and artificial intelligence, to demonstrate its cross-disciplinary validity.

Quantitatively, LLM4Perf achieves the best performance in nearly 68.8% (77 out of 112) of all evaluation scenarios, demonstrating its superior effectiveness.

MOBIMEM first introduces three specialized memory primitives to decouple agent evolution from model weights: (1) Profile Memory uses a lightweight distance-graph (DisGraph) structure to align with user preferences, resolving the accuracy-latency trade-off in user profile retrieval; (2) Experience Memory employs multi-level templates to instantiate execution logic for new tasks, ensuring capability generalization; and (3) Action Memory records fine-grained interaction sequences, reducing the reliance on expensive model inference. Building upon this memory architecture, MOBIMEM further integrates a suite of OS-inspired services to orchestrate execution: a scheduler that coordinates parallel sub-task execution and memory operations; an agent record-and-replay (AgentRR) mechanism that enables safe and efficient action reuse; and a context-aware exception handling that ensures graceful recovery from user interruptions and runtime errors.\n  Evaluation on AndroidWorld and top-50 apps shows that MOBIMEM achieves 83.1% profile alignment with 23.83 ms retrieval time (280x faster than GraphRAG baselines), improves task success rates by up to 50.3%, and reduces end-to-end latency by up to 9x on mobile devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Faults in compilers can have severe consequences and thus effective localization and resolution of compiler bugs are crucial. Problem: In practice, developers often examine version history to identify and investigate bug-inducing commit (BIC) for fixing bugs. However, while numerous sophisticated Spectrum-Based Fault Localization (SBFL) techniques have been proposed for compiler fault isolation, their effectiveness has not been evaluated against the BIC-based strategies widely adopted in practice. Objective: This study aims to bridge this gap by directly comparing a BIC-based strategy, Basic, with representative SBFL techniques in the context of compiler fault localization. The BIC-based strategy closely aligns with common developer practices, as it directly identifies the BIC and treats the files modified in that commit as faulty candidates. Method: The Basic identifies the most recent good release and earliest bad release, and then employs a binary search to pinpoint the bug-inducing commit. All files modified in the identified commit are flagged as potentially faulty. We rigorously compare Basic against SBFL-based techniques using a benchmark consisting of 60 GCC bugs and 60 LLVM bugs. Result: Our analysis reveals that Basic performs comparably to, and in many cases outperforms, state-of-the-art SBFL-based techniques, particularly on the critical Top-1 and Top-5 ranking metrics. Conclusion: This study provides new insights into the practical effectiveness of SBFL-based techniques in real-world compiler debugging scenarios.

Most of the standard RAG frameworks regard all retrieved information as equally reliable, overlooking the varying credibility and interconnected nature of large textual corpora. GraphRAG approaches offer potential improvement to RAG systems by integrating knowledge graphs, which structure information into nodes and edges, capture entity relationships, and enable multi-step logical traversal. However, GraphRAG is not always an ideal solution as it depends on high-quality graph representations of the corpus, which requires either pre-existing knowledge graphs that are expensive to build and update, or automated graph construction pipelines that are often unreliable. Moreover, systems following this paradigm typically use large language models to guide graph traversal and evidence retrieval, leading to challenges similar to those encountered with standard RAG. In this paper, we propose a novel RAG framework that employs the spreading activation algorithm to retrieve information from a corpus of documents interconnected by automatically constructed knowledge graphs, thereby enhancing the performance of large language models on complex tasks such as multi-hop question answering.

We find that for today's black-box, secret-bearing API calls, Web Proofs appear to be the most practical choice, with overhead typically under 3$\\times$ compared to direct API calls, while for public API calls, a lower-overhead TEE Proxy is often sufficient. As a case study, we deploy a verifiable trading agent that produces proofs for each decision and composes Web Proofs with a TEE Proxy. Our results demonstrate that practical, host-agnostic authentication is already possible with current technology, laying the foundation for future systems that achieve full host-independent autonomy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We address this gap by repositioning the LLM as an intelligent judge that evaluates, explains, and strategically coordinates an ensemble of foundation models.

Prevailing efforts to address this through enhancing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are trapped in a dilemma: template-based datasets are scalable but structurally rigid, while manual annotation is linguistically diverse but unscalable and, critically, computationally imprecise. We introduce SPRITE, a novel framework that overcomes this dilemma by leveraging simulators and large models to programmatically synthesize scalable, diverse, and high-quality spatial reasoning data. The core innovation of SPRITE is to reframe ground-truth generation as a code-generation task. We utilize LLMs to compile complex spatial questions into executable programs, which are then verified against high-precision scene meta-information extracted from simulators. This ensures our ground truth is both computationally precise and verifiable, while the generative power of LLMs provides vast linguistic diversity. Leveraging this pipeline, we have curated a dataset encompassing 3 simulators, 11k+ scenes, and 300k+ image/video instruction-tuning pairs. We demonstrate that a VLM trained on our data achieves significant performance gains on multiple spatial benchmarks and outperforms other open-source datasets of equivalent size. Furthermore, a scalability analysis confirms our hypothesis that overcoming the low-diversity nature of traditional template methods is essential for building robust, generalizable spatial intelligence.

To address this gap, we provide a structured systematization of obfuscation techniques and evaluate them under a unified framework. Specifically, we categorize existing obfuscation methods into three major classes (layout, data flow, and control flow) covering 11 subcategories and 19 concrete techniques. We implement these techniques across four programming languages (Solidity, C, C++, and Python) using a consistent LLM-driven approach, and evaluate their effects on 15 LLMs spanning four model families (DeepSeek, OpenAI, Qwen, and LLaMA), as well as on two coding agents (GitHub Copilot and Codex).

In this work, we propose an efficient and resilient white-box watermarking framework that embeds ownership information into the internal parameters of a DNN using chaotic sequences. The watermark is generated using a logistic map, a well-known chaotic function, producing a sequence that is sensitive to its initialization parameters.

The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through extensive experiments on image classification tasks using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. The results show that the embedded watermark remains detectable after fine-tuning, with negligible loss in model accuracy. In addition to numerical recovery of the watermark, we perform visual analyses using weight density plots and construct activation-based classifiers to distinguish between original, watermarked, and tampered models.

Monte Carlo simulations over 5\\,000 PoQ rounds demonstrate that the cost-aware reward scheme consistently assigns higher average rewards to high quality low cost inference models and to efficient evaluators, while penalizing slow low quality nodes.

However, the sensitive nature of data (e.g., eye-tracking) used in these systems raises significant privacy concerns, as adversaries can exploit these data and models to infer and leak personal information through membership inference attacks (MIA) and re-identification (RDA) with a high success rate. Researchers have proposed various techniques to mitigate such privacy attacks, including differential privacy (DP). However, AI XR datasets often contain numerous features, and applying DP uniformly can introduce unnecessary noise to less relevant features, degrade model accuracy, and increase inference time, limiting real-time XR deployment. Motivated by this, we propose a novel framework combining explainable AI (XAI) and DP-enabled privacy-preserving mechanisms to defend against privacy attacks. Specifically, we leverage post-hoc explanations to identify the most influential features in AI XR models and selectively apply DP to those features during inference. We evaluate our XAI-guided DP approach on three state-of-the-art AI XR models and three datasets: cybersickness, emotion, and activity classification. Our results show that the proposed method reduces MIA and RDA success rates by up to 43% and 39%, respectively, for cybersickness tasks while preserving model utility with up to 97% accuracy using Transformer models. Furthermore, it improves inference time by up to ~2x compared to traditional DP approaches. To demonstrate practicality, we deploy the XAI-guided DP AI XR models on an HTC VIVE Pro headset and develop a user interface (UI), namely PrivateXR, allowing users to adjust privacy levels (e.g., low, medium, high) while receiving real-time task predictions, protecting user privacy during XR gameplay.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

DFF leverages explainable-AI (XAI) methods to identify and compare the decisive features driving the SUT's outputs for matched real-synthetic pairs.

We systematically benchmark large language and vision-language models on two representative central-processing-unit tiers widely used for local inference: a MacBook Pro M2, reflecting mainstream laptop-class deployment, and a Raspberry Pi 5, representing constrained, low-power embedded settings. Using a unified methodology based on continuous sampling of processor and memory usage together with area-under-curve integration, we characterize how computational load scales with input text length for language models and with image resolution for vision-language models. We uncover two empirical scaling laws: (1) computational cost for language-model inference scales approximately linearly with token length; and (2) vision-language models exhibit a preprocessing-driven \"resolution knee\", where compute remains constant above an internal resolution clamp and decreases sharply below it. Beyond these laws, we show that quantum-inspired compression reduces processor and memory usage by up to 71.9% and energy consumption by up to 62%, while preserving or improving semantic accuracy.

Rather than adding another digital tool, large language models reconfigure reading, writing, and coding into hybrid human-AI workflows, raising concerns about epistemic automation, cognitive offloading, and the de-professiona\\-lisation of teachers. This paper proposes \\emph{Cyber Humanism in Education} as a framework for reclaiming human agency in this landscape. We conceptualise AI-enabled learning environments as socio-technical infrastructures co-authored by humans and machines, and position educators and learners as epistemic agents and \\emph{algorithmic citizens} who have both the right and the responsibility to shape these infrastructures.\n  We articulate three pillars for cyber-humanist design, \\emph{reflexive competence}, \\emph{algorithmic citizenship}, and \\emph{dialogic design}, and relate them to major international digital and AI competence frameworks. We then present higher-education case studies that operationalise these ideas through \\emph{prompt-based learning} and a new \\emph{Conversational AI Educator} certification within the EPICT ecosystem. The findings show how such practices can strengthen epistemic agency while surfacing tensions around workload, equity, and governance, and outline implications for the future of AI-rich, human-centred education.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The former limits the deductive power of consistent reasoning systems while the later bounds long-term prediction under finite precision. We show that these two extrema together impose structural bounds on an agent's ability to reason about its own predictive capabilities. In particular, an algorithmic agent cannot compute its own maximal prediction horizon generally. This perspective clarifies inherent trade-offs between reasoning, prediction, and self-analysis in intelligent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To ensure that such systems are safe to operate and deploy, it is imperative to develop efficient methods that can provide a sound and interpretable representation of the BBAI's capabilities. This paper shows that PDDL-style representations can be used to efficiently learn and model an input BBAI's planning capabilities. It uses the Monte-Carlo tree search paradigm to systematically create test tasks, acquire data, and prune the hypothesis space of possible symbolic models. Learned models describe a BBAI's capabilities, the conditions under which they can be executed, and the possible outcomes of executing them along with their associated probabilities. Theoretical results show soundness, completeness and convergence of the learned models. Empirical results with multiple BBAI systems illustrate the scope, efficiency, and accuracy of the presented methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To enable proactive pain management, we propose a hybrid machine learning and large language model pipeline that predicts pain episodes within 48 and 72 hours of hospitalization using both structured and unstructured electronic health record data. A retrospective cohort of 266 inpatients was analyzed, with features including demographics, tumor stage, vital signs, and WHO-tiered analgesic use. The machine learning module captured temporal medication trends, while the large language model interpreted ambiguous dosing records and free-text clinical notes. Integrating these modalities improved sensitivity and interpretability. Our framework achieved an accuracy of 0.874 (48h) and 0.917 (72h), with an improvement in sensitivity of 8.6% and 10.4% due to the augmentation of large language model. This hybrid approach offers a clinically interpretable and scalable tool for early pain episode forecasting, with potential to enhance treatment precision and optimize resource allocation in oncology care.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This paper introduces CitySeeker, a novel benchmark designed to assess VLMs' spatial reasoning and decision-making capabilities for exploring embodied urban navigation to address implicit needs. CitySeeker includes 6,440 trajectories across 8 cities, capturing diverse visual characteristics and implicit needs in 7 goal-driven scenarios. Extensive experiments reveal that even top-performing models (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct) achieve only 21.1% task completion. We find key bottlenecks in error accumulation in long-horizon reasoning, inadequate spatial cognition, and deficient experiential recall. To further analyze them, we investigate a series of exploratory strategies-Backtracking Mechanisms, Enriching Spatial Cognition, and Memory-Based Retrieval (BCR), inspired by human cognitive mapping's emphasis on iterative observation-reasoning cycles and adaptive path optimization. Our analysis provides actionable insights for developing VLMs with robust spatial intelligence required for tackling \"last-mile\" navigation challenges.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
