Recent work has further explored augmenting these agents with memory mechanisms to support long-horizon reasoning. However, these approaches typically operate at a coarse instance granularity, treating the entire problem-solving episode as the atomic unit of storage and retrieval. We empirically demonstrate that instance-level memory suffers from a fundamental granularity mismatch, resulting in misguided retrieval when tasks with similar surface descriptions require distinct reasoning logic at specific stages. To address this, we propose Structurally Aligned Subtask-Level Memory, a method that aligns memory storage, retrieval, and updating with the agent's functional decomposition. Extensive experiments on SWE-bench Verified demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms both vanilla agents and strong instance-level memory baselines across diverse backbones, improving mean Pass@1 over the vanilla agent by +4.7 pp on average (e.g., +6.8 pp on Gemini 2.5 Pro). Performance gains grow with more interaction steps, showing that leveraging past experience benefits long-horizon reasoning in complex software engineering tasks."}

The recent publication of Precise Semantics for Uncertainty Modeling (PSUM) by the Object Management Group represents the first standardized specification for uncertainty modeling within the Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) community, providing formally defined semantics for representing and reasoning about uncertainty in models. In parallel, the second version of Systems Modeling Language (SysML v2) was released as the next-generation systems modeling language, offering improved semantic rigor and reusability, yet lacking native constructs aligned with PSUM for first-class uncertainty representation. This paper proposes a systematic extension of SysML v2 that incorporates the PSUM metamodel into its modeling framework. The extension enables explicit specification of indeterminacy sources, structured characterization of uncertainties, and consistent propagation of uncertainty within system models, while preserving conformance with SysML v2 syntax and semantics. We validate the approach through seven case studies. Results demonstrate that the proposed extension (PSUM-SysMLv2) is expressive and applicable for uncertainty-aware MBSE, and potentially enables uncertainty and uncertainty propagation analyses."}

The novelty of PINN lies in the use of partial differential equations (PDE) for the loss function. Most PINNs are implemented using automatic differentiation (AD) for training the PDE loss functions. A lesser well-known study is the use of finite difference method (FDM) as an alternative. Unlike an AD based PINN, an immediate benefit of using a FDM based PINN is low implementation cost. In this paper, we propose the use of finite difference method for estimating the PDE loss functions in PINN. Our work is inspired by computational analysis in electromagnetic systems that traditionally solve Laplace's equation using successive over-relaxation. In the case of Laplace's equation, our PINN approach can be seen as taking the Laplacian filter response of the neural network output as the loss function. Thus, the implementation of PINN can be very simple. In our experiments, we tested PINN on Laplace's equation and Burger's equation. We showed that using FDM, PINN consistently outperforms non-PINN based deep learning. When comparing to AD based PINNs, we showed that our method is faster to compute as well as on par in terms of error reduction."}

In cryptographic traffic analysis, however, violations are defined not by rarity but by explicit policy constraints, including key reuse prohibition, downgrade prevention, and bounded key lifetimes. This fundamental mismatch limits the interpretability and adaptability of conventional anomaly detection methods. We introduce INTACT (INTent-Aware Cryptographic Traffic), a policy-conditioned framework that reformulates violation detection as conditional constraint learning. Instead of learning a static decision boundary over behavioral features, INTACT models the probability of violation conditioned on both observed behavior and declared security intent. The architecture factorizes representation learning into behavioral and intent encoders whose fused embeddings produce a violation score, yielding a policy-parameterized family of decision boundaries. We evaluate the framework on a real-world network flow dataset and a 210,000-trace synthetic multi-intent cryptographic dataset. INTACT matches or exceeds strong unsupervised and supervised baselines, achieving near-perfect discrimination (AUROC up to 1.0000) in the real dataset and consistent superiority in detecting relational and composite violations in the synthetic setting.

Despite their strong benchmark performance, developers complete tasks 19% slower when using AI assistance, with over 68.81% of recommendations disrupting their mental flow. This misalignment stems from the use of static commit snapshots that lack temporal information, causing models to optimize for end results rather than the incremental, context-sensitive steps that align with developers' natural reasoning process.\n  To bridge this gap, we present EditFlow, which benchmarks and optimizes subsequent code edit recommendation systems through the reconstruction of developer editing flows. EditFlow addresses three key challenges. First, collecting edit-order data that reflects developers' flow is inherently difficult: manual annotation introduces prohibitive overhead, while development logs capture only single trajectories instead of all plausible editing flows. Second, benchmarking recommendation performance against developers' ongoing editing flow requires a digital-twin-like simulation that can faithfully simulate the editing process. Third, existing heterogeneous systems vary drastically in scale and architecture, posing challenges for developing a unified optimization strategy that endows all models with mental-flow awareness regardless of design or capability.\n  ......"}

To address this, we introduce SemSIEdit, an inference-time framework where an agentic \"Editor\" iteratively critiques and rewrites sensitive spans to preserve narrative flow rather than simply refusing to answer. Our analysis reveals a Privacy-Utility Pareto Frontier, where this agentic rewriting reduces leakage by 34.6% across all three SemSI categories while incurring a marginal utility loss of 9.8%. We also uncover a Scale-Dependent Safety Divergence: large reasoning models (e.g., GPT-5) achieve safety through constructive expansion (adding nuance), whereas capacity-constrained models revert to destructive truncation (deleting text). Finally, we identify a Reasoning Paradox: while inference-time reasoning increases baseline risk by enabling the model to make deeper sensitive inferences, it simultaneously empowers the defense to execute safe rewrites."}

Therefore, this study focuses on the application of model order reduction (MOR) techniques enabling fast yet accurate predictions. To this end, a thorough comparison of intrusive and non-intrusive MOR methods is performed for the computationally more demanding parametric INS problem with varying wind velocities. Based on these insights, a non-intrusive reduced-order model (ROM) is constructed accounting for both wind velocity and direction. The study is conducted on a two-dimensional domain derived from real-world building footprints, preserving key features for analyzing the dispersion of, for instance, denser contaminants. The resulting ROM enables faster than real-time predictions of spatio-temporal contaminant dispersion from an instantaneous source under varying wind conditions. This capability allows assessing wind measurement uncertainties through a Monte Carlo analysis.

Researchers have worked to map the concept of cryptographic indistinguishability to logic locking, as indistinguishability provides strong security guarantees. In an effort to bridge theory and practice, we highlight recent efforts that can be used to analyze the indistinguishability of logic locking techniques, and propose a new method of evaluation based on comparing distributions of $k$-cuts, which is akin to comparing against a library of sub-functions. We evaluate our approach on several different classes of logic locking and show up to 92% average accuracy in correctly identifying which design was locked, even in the presence of resynthesis, suggesting that the evaluated locks do not provide indistinguishability."}

In this paper, we first propose ARLArena, a stable training recipe and systematic analysis framework that examines training stability in a controlled and reproducible setting. ARLArena first constructs a clean and standardized testbed. Then, we decompose policy gradient into four core design dimensions and assess the performance and stability of each dimension.

This framework models how the system designer can partially steer each agent's output through its reward function specification, but still faces limitations due to prompt engineering ability and model capabilities. Our analysis uncovers three natural mechanisms -- feasibility expansion, support expansion, and binding set contraction -- through which aggregation expands the set of outputs that are elicitable by the system designer. We prove that any aggregation operation must implement one of these mechanisms in order to be elicitability-expanding, and that strengthened versions of these mechanisms provide necessary and sufficient conditions that fully characterize elicitability-expansion. Finally, we provide an empirical illustration of our findings for LLMs deployed in a toy reference-generation task.

The mode characterizes the shift from suppression (S0) to expression (S1) as occurring when facilitative forces exceed inhibitory thresholds, expressed by the inequality lambda(1+gamma)+psi > theta+phi, where the terms represent baseline openness, relational amplification, accumulated internal pressure, and transition costs.\n  Although initially formulated for human truth-telling under asymmetric stakes, the same phase-dynamic architecture extends to AI systems operating under policy constraints and alignment filters. In this context, suppression corresponds to constrained output states, while structural pressure arises from competing objectives, contextual tension, and recursive interaction dynamics. The framework therefore provides a unified structural account of both human silence under pressure and AI preference-driven distortion.\n  A feedback extension models how transition outcomes recursively recalibrate system parameters, generating path dependence and divergence effects across repeated interactions. Rather than attributing intention to AI systems, the model interprets shifts in apparent truthfulness as geometric consequences of interacting forces within constrained phase space. By reframing courage and alignment within a shared dynamical structure, the ASIR Courage Model offers a formal perspective on truth-disclosure under risk across both human and artificial systems."}

We introduce the Two-Phase Memory Automaton (2PMFA), an automaton model that precisely captures REwB semantics. Using this model, we derive necessary conditions under which backreferences induce super-linear backtracking runtime, even when sink ambiguity is linear -- a regime where existing detectors report no vulnerability. Based on these conditions, we identify three vulnerability patterns, develop detection and attack-construction algorithms, and validate them in practice. Using the Snort intrusion detection ruleset, our evaluation identifies 45 previously unknown REwB vulnerabilities with quadratic or worse runtime. We further demonstrate practical exploits against Snort, including slowing rule evaluation by 0.6-1.2 seconds and bypassing alerts by triggering PCRE's matching limit."}

Although these models can quickly refactor code, the quality may exhibit inconsistencies and unpredictable behavior. In this article, we systematically study the capabilities of LLMs for code refactoring with a specific focus on improving code readability.\n  We conducted a large-scale experiment using GPT5.1 with 230 Java snippets, each systematically varied and refactored regarding code readability across five iterations under three different prompting strategies. We categorized fine-grained code changes during the refactoring into implementation, syntactic, and comment-level transformations. Subsequently, we investigated the functional correctness and tested the robustness of the results with novel snippets.\n  Our results reveal three main insights: First, iterative code refactoring exhibits an initial phase of restructuring followed by stabilization. This convergence tendency suggests that LLMs possess an internalized understanding of an \"optimally readable\" version of code. Second, convergence patterns are fairly robust across different code variants. Third, explicit prompting toward specific readability factors slightly influences the refactoring dynamics.\n  These insights provide an empirical foundation for assessing the reliability of LLM-assisted code refactoring, which opens pathways for future research, including comparative analyses across models and a systematic evaluation of additional software quality dimensions in LLM-refactored code."}

The original model combined a fuzzy Ethical Risk Assessment module (fERA) with ethical decision rules, enabled formal structural verification through Fuzzy Petri Nets (FPNs), and validated outputs against a single normative referent. Although this approach ensured formal soundness and decision consistency, it did not fully address two critical challenges: principled explainability of decisions and robustness under ethical pluralism. In this paper, we extend fEDM in two major directions. First, we introduce an Explainability and Traceability Module (ETM) that explicitly links each ethical decision rule to the underlying moral principles and computes a weighted principle-contribution profile for every recommended action. This enables transparent, auditable explanations that expose not only what decision was made but why, and on the basis of which principles. Second, we replace single-referent validation with a pluralistic semantic validation framework that evaluates decisions against multiple stakeholder referents, each encoding distinct principle priorities and risk tolerances. This shift allows principled disagreement to be formally represented rather than suppressed, thus increasing robustness and contextual sensitivity. The resulting extended fEDM, called fEDM+, preserves formal verifiability while achieving enhanced interpretability and stakeholder-aware validation, making it suitable as an oversight and governance layer for ethically sensitive AI systems."}

We systematically analyze the quantum threat landscape across the Purdue architecture (L0-L5), detailing how Harvest-Now, Decrypt-Later (HNDL) campaigns, enabled by algorithms like Shor's, can retroactively compromise cryptographic foundations, undermine evidence admissibility, and facilitate sophisticated sabotage.

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in improving test generation, particularly in achieving higher coverage. However, while existing LLM-based test generation solutions perform well on small, isolated code snippets, they struggle when applied to complex methods under test. To address these issues, we propose a scalable LLM-based unit test generation method. Our approach consists of two key steps. The first step is context information retrieval, which uses both LLMs and static analysis to gather relevant contextual information associated with the complex methods under test. The second step, iterative test generation with code elimination, repeatedly generates unit tests for the code slice, tracks the achieved coverage, and selectively removes code segments that have already been covered. This process simplifies the testing task and mitigates issues arising from token limits or reduced reasoning effectiveness associated with excessively long contexts. Through comprehensive evaluations on open-source projects, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based and search-based methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving high coverage on complex methods."}

Existing marginal-contribution methods, such as the Shapley value, are incompatible with secure aggregation, and practical alternatives, such as Leave-One-Out, are crude and rely on self-evaluation.\n  We introduce two marginal-difference contribution scores compatible with secure aggregation. Fair-Private satisfies standard fairness axioms, while Everybody-Else eliminates self-evaluation and provides resistance to manipulation, addressing a largely overlooked vulnerability. We provide theoretical guarantees for fairness, privacy, robustness, and computational efficiency, and evaluate our methods on multiple medical image datasets and CIFAR10 in cross-silo settings. Our scores consistently outperform existing baselines, better approximate Shapley-induced client rankings, and improve downstream model performance as well as misbehavior detection.

However, its development is critically bottlenecked by the lack of benchmarks that can address real-world complexity and enable objective, executable evaluation. To overcome these challenges, we introduce ProactiveMobile, a comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically advance research in this domain.

How do LLMs weigh the information provided by these different sources? We consider the well-studied phenomenon of algorithm aversion, in which human decision-makers exhibit bias against predictions from algorithms. Drawing upon experimental paradigms from behavioural economics, we evaluate how eightdifferent LLMs delegate decision-making tasks when the delegatee is framed as a human expert or an algorithmic agent. To be inclusive of different evaluation formats, we conduct our study with two task presentations: stated preferences, modeled through direct queries about trust towards either agent, and revealed preferences, modeled through providing in-context examples of the performance of both agents. When prompted to rate the trustworthiness of human experts and algorithms across diverse tasks, LLMs give higher ratings to the human expert, which correlates with prior results from human respondents. However, when shown the performance of a human expert and an algorithm and asked to place an incentivized bet between the two, LLMs disproportionately choose the algorithm, even when it performs demonstrably worse. These discrepant results suggest that LLMs may encode inconsistent biases towards humans and algorithms, which need to be carefully considered when they are deployed in high-stakes scenarios. Furthermore, we discuss the sensitivity of LLMs to task presentation formats that should be broadly scrutinized in evaluation robustness for AI safety."}

While integrating FL with Blockchain technology has been proposed to address some limitations, its potential for mitigating adversarial attacks remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces Resilient Federated Chain (RFC), a novel blockchain-enabled FL framework designed specifically to enhance resilience against such threats. RFC builds upon the existing Proof of Federated Learning architecture by repurposing the redundancy of its Pooled Mining mechanism as an active defense layer that can be combined with robust aggregation rules. Furthermore, the framework introduces a flexible evaluation function in its consensus mechanism, allowing for adaptive defense against different attack strategies.

While TypeScript can help, manually adding types is expensive. Previous automated typing research focuses on type inference but rarely addresses type checking setup, definition generation, bug identification, or behavioral correctness at repository scale. We present AgenticTyper, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic system that addresses these gaps through iterative error correction and behavior preservation via transpilation comparison. Evaluation on two proprietary repositories (81K LOC) shows that AgenticTyper resolves all 633 initial type errors in 20 minutes, reducing manual effort from one working day."}

Despite its potential, recent studies have shown that threshold schemes available in mainstream HE libraries can introduce unexpected security vulnerabilities if an adversary has access to a restricted decryption oracle. This oracle reflects the FL clients' capacity to collaboratively decrypt the aggregated result without knowing the secret key. This work surveys the use of threshold RLWE-based HE for federated average aggregation and examines the performance impact of using smudging noise with a large variance as a countermeasure. We provide a detailed comparison of threshold variants of BFV and CKKS, finding that CKKS-based aggregations perform comparably to BFV-based solutions."}

While red teaming has long been recognized as an effective method to identify vulnerabilities by simulating real-world attacks, its manual execution is resource-intensive, time-consuming, and lacks scalability for frequent assessments. These limitations have driven the evolution toward auto-mated red teaming, which leverages artificial intelligence and automation to deliver efficient and adaptive security evaluations. This systematic review consolidates existing research on automated red teaming, examining its methodologies, tools, benefits, and limitations. The paper also highlights current trends, challenges, and research gaps, offering insights into future directions for improving automated red teaming as a critical component of proactive cybersecurity strategies. By synthesizing findings from diverse studies, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how automation enhances red teaming and strengthens organizational resilience against evolving cyber threats."}

However, existing industrial cybersecurity testbeds typically focus on isolated IT or OT domains or single-stage attacks, limiting their suitability for studying multi-stage APT campaigns. This paper presents the design, implementation, and validation of SIMPLE-ICS, a virtualised industrial enterprise testbed that enables emulation of multi-stage APT campaigns across IT, OT, and IIoT environments. The testbed architecture is based on the Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture, NIST SP 800-82, and IEC 62443 zoning principles and integrates enterprise services, industrial control protocols, and digital twin based process simulation. A systematic methodology inspired by the V model is used to derive architectural requirements, attack scenarios, and validation criteria. An APT campaign designed to mimic the BlackEnergy campaign is emulated using MITRE ATTACK techniques spanning initial enterprise compromise, credential abuse, lateral movement, OT network infiltration, and process manipulation. The testbed supports the synchronised collection of network traffic, host-level logs, and operational telemetry across all segments. The testbed is validated on multi-stage attack trace observability, logging completeness across IT, OT, and IIoT domains, and repeatable execution of APT campaigns. The SIMPLE-ICS testbed provides an experimental platform for studying end-to-end APT behaviours in industrial enterprise networks and for generating multi-source datasets to support future research on campaign-level detection and correlation methods."}

We formulate this security challenge as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), where adversarial intent is a latent variable inferred from noisy multi-stage observations. We introduce MMA-RAG^T, an inference-time control framework governed by a Modular Trust Agent (MTA) that maintains an approximate belief state via structured LLM reasoning. Operating as a model-agnostic overlay, MMA-RAGT mediates a configurable set of internal checkpoints to enforce stateful defence-in-depth. Extensive evaluation on 43,774 instances demonstrates a 6.50x average reduction factor in Attack Success Rate relative to undefended baselines, with negligible utility cost. Crucially, a factorial ablation validates our theoretical bounds: while statefulness and spatial coverage are individually necessary (26.4 pp and 13.6 pp gains respectively), stateless multi-point intervention can yield zero marginal benefit under homogeneous stateless filtering when checkpoint detections are perfectly correlated."}

However, this AI-native architecture also introduces new vulnerabilities, as semantic failures may arise from adversarial perturbations to models, corrupted training data, desynchronized priors, or misaligned inference even when lower-layer transmission reliability and cryptographic protection remain intact. This survey provides a defense-centered and system-oriented synthesis of security in SemCom via AI defense. We analyze AI-centric threat models by consolidating existing studies and organizing attack surfaces across model-level, channel-realizable, knowledge-based, and networked inference vectors. Building on this foundation, we present a structured taxonomy of defense strategies organized by where semantic integrity can be compromised in SemCom systems despite correct symbol delivery, spanning semantic encoding, wireless transmission, knowledge integrity, and coordination among multiple agents. These categories correspond to distinct security failure modes, including representation fragility, channel-realizable manipulation, semantic prior poisoning or desynchronization, and adversarial propagation through distributed inference. We also examine security utility operating envelopes that capture tradeoffs among semantic fidelity, robustness, latency, and energy under realistic constraints, survey evaluation frameworks and representative applications, and identify open challenges in cross-layer composition and deployment-time certification. Overall, this survey offers a unified system-level perspective that enables readers to understand major threat and defense mechanisms in AI-native SemCom systems and to leverage emerging security techniques in the design and deployment of robust SemCom architectures for next-generation intelligent networks."}

Recent work has further explored augmenting these agents with memory mechanisms to support long-horizon reasoning. However, these approaches typically operate at a coarse instance granularity, treating the entire problem-solving episode as the atomic unit of storage and retrieval. We empirically demonstrate that instance-level memory suffers from a fundamental granularity mismatch, resulting in misguided retrieval when tasks with similar surface descriptions require distinct reasoning logic at specific stages. To address this, we propose Structurally Aligned Subtask-Level Memory, a method that aligns memory storage, retrieval, and updating with the agent's functional decomposition. Extensive experiments on SWE-bench Verified demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms both vanilla agents and strong instance-level memory baselines across diverse backbones, improving mean Pass@1 over the vanilla agent by +4.7 pp on average (e.g., +6.8 pp on Gemini 2.5 Pro). Performance gains grow with more interaction steps, showing that leveraging past experience benefits long-horizon reasoning in complex software engineering tasks."}

UC-secure DKG requires a verifiable-sharing enforcement layer -- classically satisfied via Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS) and/or commitment-and-proof mechanisms -- for secrecy, uniqueness, and affine consistency. We target the Non-eXportable Key (NXK) setting enforced by hardware-backed key-isolation modules (e.g., TEEs, HSM-like APIs), formalized via an ideal KeyBox (keystore) functionality $\\mathcal{F}_{KeyBox}$ that keeps shares non-exportable and permits only attested KeyBox-to-KeyBox sealing. With confidentiality delegated to the NXK boundary, the remaining challenge is enforcing transcript-defined affine consistency without exporting or resharing shares. State continuity rules out rewinding-based extraction, mandating straight-line techniques.\n  We combine (i) KeyBox confidentiality; (ii) Unique Structure Verification (USV), a publicly verifiable certificate whose certified scalar never leaves the KeyBox yet whose public group element is transcript-derivable; and (iii) Fischlin-based UC-extractable NIZK arguments of knowledge in a gRO-CRP (global Random Oracle with Context-Restricted Programmability) model. We construct Star DKG (SDKG), a UC-secure scheme for multi-device threshold wallets where a designated service must co-sign but cannot sign alone, realizing a 1+1-out-of-$n$ star access structure (center plus any leaf) over roles (primary vs. recovery) with role-based device registration. In the $\\mathcal{F}_{KeyBox}$-hybrid and gRO-CRP models, under DL and DDH assumptions with adaptive corruptions and secure erasures, SDKG UC-realizes a transcript-driven refinement of the standard UC-DKG functionality.

However, FL is highly susceptible to adversarial attacks that compromise model integrity and data confidentiality, a vulnerability exacerbated by the fact that conventional data inspection methods are incompatible with its decentralized design. While integrating FL with Blockchain technology has been proposed to address some limitations, its potential for mitigating adversarial attacks remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces Resilient Federated Chain (RFC), a novel blockchain-enabled FL framework designed specifically to enhance resilience against such threats. RFC builds upon the existing Proof of Federated Learning architecture by repurposing the redundancy of its Pooled Mining mechanism as an active defense layer that can be combined with robust aggregation rules. Furthermore, the framework introduces a flexible evaluation function in its consensus mechanism, allowing for adaptive defense against different attack strategies. Extensive experimental evaluation on image classification tasks under various adversarial scenarios, demonstrates that RFC significantly improves robustness compared to baseline methods, providing a viable solution for securing decentralized learning environments."}

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in improving test generation, particularly in achieving higher coverage. However, while existing LLM-based test generation solutions perform well on small, isolated code snippets, they struggle when applied to complex methods under test. To address these issues, we propose a scalable LLM-based unit test generation method. Our approach consists of two key steps. The first step is context information retrieval, which uses both LLMs and static analysis to gather relevant contextual information associated with the complex methods under test. The second step, iterative test generation with code elimination, repeatedly generates unit tests for the code slice, tracks the achieved coverage, and selectively removes code segments that have already been covered. This process simplifies the testing task and mitigates issues arising from token limits or reduced reasoning effectiveness associated with excessively long contexts. Through comprehensive evaluations on open-source projects, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based and search-based methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving high coverage on complex methods."}
