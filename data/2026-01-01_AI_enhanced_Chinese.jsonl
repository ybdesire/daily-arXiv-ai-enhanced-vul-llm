The 10 weather station locations in Oman and their corresponding governorates are Seeb (in Muscat), Salalah (in Dhofar), Buraimi (in Al Buraimi), Masirah (in Ash Sharqiyah South), Thumrait (in Dhofar), Sur (in Ash Sharqiyah South), Khasab (in Musandam), Sohar (in Sohar), Fahud (in Az Zahirah), and Saiq (in Ad Dakhiliyah). The obtained wind speed distributions at these weather stations are then used to predict the annual energy production (AEP) for a proposed reference amount of 1 MWp of wind turbine capacity, and this specific AEP is designated here by the term \"normalized annual energy production (NAEP).\" The direction of the wind is also analyzed statistically over the same period to identify the more probable wind directions. Four locations were clearly distinguishable as being windy compared to the others. The simulated probability of exceeding a feasible 6 m/s (21.6 km/h) wind speed in these locations is 41.71% in Thumrait, 37.77% in Masirah, 29.53% in Sur, and 17.03% in Fahud. The NAEP values in these four locations are estimated as 1.727 GWh/MWp/year, 1.419 GWh/MWp/year, 1.038 GWh/MWp/year, and 0.602 GWh/MWp/year, respectively. The wind in the location of Thumrait is not only the fastest (on average) among the selected locations but also the most unidirectional, blowing almost always from the south-south-east (SSE) direction, and both features make this non-coastal location in southern Oman, with an altitude of about 467 m, an attractive site for utility-scale wind farms.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We address three fundamental problems in customer risk analytics: data silos preventing holistic relationship assessment, extreme behavioral class imbalance, and suboptimal customer intervention strategies that fail to balance compliance costs with relationship value. We develop an integrated customer intelligence framework combining federated learning, relational network analysis, and adaptive targeting policies. Our federated graph neural network enables collaborative behavior modeling across competing institutions without compromising proprietary customer data, using privacy-preserving embeddings to capture cross-market relational patterns. We introduce cross-bank Personalized PageRank to identify coordinated behavioral clusters providing interpretable customer network segmentation for risk managers. A hierarchical reinforcement learning mechanism optimizes dynamic intervention targeting, calibrating escalation policies to maximize prevention value while minimizing customer friction and operational costs. Analyzing 1.4 million customer transactions across seven markets, our approach reduces false positive and false negative rates to 4.64% and 11.07%, substantially outperforming single-institution models. The framework prevents 79.25% of potential losses versus 49.41% under fixed-rule policies, with optimal market-specific targeting thresholds reflecting heterogeneous customer base characteristics.

Each candidate improvement is extracted from successful trajectories, normalized into a skill with an explicit interface, and promoted only after passing verifier-backed replay and contract checks. Rewards are decomposed into reconstructible components derived from replayable evidence, enabling independent audit of promotion decisions and learning signals. ASG-SI further integrates experience synthesis for scalable stress testing and continual memory control to preserve long-horizon performance under bounded context.\n  We present a complete system architecture, threat model, and security analysis, and provide a fully runnable reference implementation that demonstrates verifier-backed reward construction, skill compilation, audit logging, and measurable improvement under continual task streams.

Static benchmarks like MMLU and TruthfulQA cannot distinguish a model that lacks knowledge from one whose verification mechanisms collapse when information degrades or adversaries probe for weaknesses. We introduce the Drill-Down and Fabricate Test (DDFT), a protocol that measures epistemic robustness: a model's ability to maintain factual accuracy under progressive semantic compression and adversarial fabrication. We propose a two-system cognitive model comprising a Semantic System that generates fluent text and an Epistemic Verifier that validates factual accuracy. Our findings, based on evaluating 9 frontier models across 8 knowledge domains at 5 compression levels (1,800 turn-level evaluations), reveal that epistemic robustness is orthogonal to conventional design paradigms. Neither parameter count (r=0.083, p=0.832) nor architectural type (r=0.153, p=0.695) significantly predicts robustness, suggesting it emerges from training methodology and verification mechanisms distinct from current approaches. Error detection capability strongly predicts overall robustness (rho=-0.817, p=0.007), indicating this is the critical bottleneck.

As organizations increasingly adopt multi-cluster and hybrid cloud deployments, maintaining consistent policy enforcement, predictable performance, and operational stability across heterogeneous gateway environments becomes challenging. Existing approaches typically manage security, governance, and performance as loosely coupled concerns, leading to configuration drift, delayed policy propagation, and unstable runtime behavior under dynamic workloads. This paper presents a governance-aware, intent-driven architecture for coordinated API gateway management in multi-cluster cloud environments. The proposed approach expresses security, governance, and performance objectives as high-level declarative intents, which are systematically translated into enforceable gateway configurations and continuously validated through policy verification and telemetry-driven feedback. By decoupling intent specification from enforcement while enabling bounded, policy-compliant adaptation, the architecture supports heterogeneous gateway implementations without compromising governance guarantees or service-level objectives. A prototype implementation across multiple Kubernetes clusters demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed design. Experimental results show up to a 42% reduction in policy drift, a 31% improvement in configuration propagation time, and sustained p95 latency overhead below 6% under variable workloads, compared to manual and declarative baseline approaches.

In real-world software engineering, however, such curated datasets are rarely available during the initial cold start of agent development, where engineers instead face messy production logs and evolving failure modes. We present ROAD (Reflective Optimization via Automated Debugging), a novel framework that bypasses the need for refined datasets by treating optimization as a dynamic debugging investigation rather than a stochastic search. Unlike traditional mutation strategies, ROAD utilizes a specialized multi-agent architecture, comprising an Analyzer for root-cause analysis, an Optimizer for pattern aggregation, and a Coach for strategy integration, to convert unstructured failure logs into robust, structured Decision Tree Protocols. We evaluated ROAD across both a standardized academic benchmark and a live production Knowledge Management engine. Experimental results demonstrate that ROAD is highly sample-efficient, achieving a 5.6 percent increase in success rate (73.6 percent to 79.2 percent) and a 3.8 percent increase in search accuracy within just three automated iterations. Furthermore, on complex reasoning tasks in the retail domain, ROAD improved agent performance by approximately 19 percent relative to the baseline.

Conversely, cognitive architectures such as Soar offer structured and interpretable reasoning processes, yet their knowledge acquisition is notoriously laborious. To address these complementary challenges, we propose a novel cognitive recommender agent called CogRec which synergizes the strengths of LLMs with the Soar cognitive architecture. CogRec leverages Soar as its core symbolic reasoning engine and leverages an LLM for knowledge initialization to populate its working memory with production rules. The agent operates on a Perception-Cognition-Action(PCA) cycle. Upon encountering an impasse, it dynamically queries the LLM to obtain a reasoned solution. This solution is subsequently transformed into a new symbolic production rule via Soar's chunking mechanism, thereby enabling robust online learning. This learning paradigm allows the agent to continuously evolve its knowledge base and furnish highly interpretable rationales for its recommendations.

First, we present a foundational taxonomy of desirable agent behaviors for enterprise software engineering, derived from an analysis of 91 sets of user-defined agent rules. This taxonomy defines four key expectations of agent behavior: Adhere to Standards and Processes, Ensure Code Quality and Reliability, Solving Problems Effectively, and Collaborating with the User.\n  Second, recognizing that these expectations are not static, we introduce the Context-Adaptive Behavior (CAB) Framework. This emerging framework reveals how behavioral expectations shift along two empirically-derived axes: the Time Horizon (from immediate needs to future ideals), established through interviews with 15 expert engineers, and the Type of Work (from enterprise production to rapid prototyping, for example), identified through a prompt analysis of a prototyping agent.

Our method combines vision-based frame processing with systematic state-space exploration using graph-structured representations. It segments visual frames into meaningful components, prioritizes actions based on visual salience, and maintains a directed graph of explored states and transitions. By tracking visited states and tested actions, the agent prioritizes actions that provide the shortest path to untested state-action pairs.

We demonstrate that out-of-distribution prompts can manipulate the routing strategy such that all tokens are consistently routed to the same set of top-$k$ experts, which creates computational bottlenecks on certain devices while forcing others to idle. This converts an efficiency mechanism into a denial-of-service attack vector, leading to violations of service-level agreements for time to first token. We propose RepetitionCurse, a low-cost black-box strategy to exploit this vulnerability. By identifying a universal flaw in MoE router behavior, RepetitionCurse constructs adversarial prompts using simple repetitive token patterns in a model-agnostic manner.

To address this issue, we reformulate SDP as a change-aware prediction task, in which models reason over code changes of a file within successive project versions, rather than relying on static file snapshots. Building on this formulation, we propose an LLM-driven, change-aware, multi-agent debate framework. Our experiments on multiple PROMISE projects show that traditional models achieve inflated F1, while failing on rare but critical defect-transition cases. In contrast, our change-aware reasoning and multi-agent debate framework yields more balanced performance across evolution subsets and significantly improves sensitivity to defect introductions.

To address this limitation, we propose Risk-aware Stepwise Alignment (RSA), a novel alignment method that explicitly incorporates risk awareness into the policy optimization process by leveraging a class of nested risk measures. Specifically, RSA formulates safety alignment as a token-level risk-aware constrained policy optimization problem and solves it through a stepwise alignment procedure that yields token-level policy updates derived from the nested risk measures.

Although recent studies have adopted several methods to detect code hallucination, most of these approaches remain limited to coarse-grained detection and lack specialized techniques for fine-grained hallucination localization. This study introduces a novel method, called CoHalLo, which achieves line-level code hallucination localization by probing the hidden-layer vectors from hallucination detection models. CoHalLo uncovers the key syntactic information driving the model's hallucination judgments and locates the hallucinating code lines accordingly. Specifically, we first fine-tune the hallucination detection model on manually annotated datasets to ensure that it learns features pertinent to code syntactic information. Subsequently, we designed a probe network that projects high-dimensional latent vectors onto a low-dimensional syntactic subspace, generating vector tuples and reconstructing the predicted abstract syntax tree (P-AST). By comparing P-AST with the original abstract syntax tree (O-AST) extracted from the input AI-generated code, we identify the key syntactic structures associated with hallucinations. This information is then used to pinpoint hallucinated code lines. To evaluate CoHalLo's performance, we manually collected a dataset of code hallucinations. The experimental results show that CoHalLo achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 0.4253, Top-3 accuracy of 0.6149, Top-5 accuracy of 0.7356, Top-10 accuracy of 0.8333, IFA of 5.73, Recall@1% Effort of 0.052721, and Effort@20% Recall of 0.155269, which outperforms the baseline methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, unlike their homogeneous-ISA counterparts, explicit software support for bridging ISA heterogeneity is required. The lack of a compilation toolchain ready to support heterogeneous-ISA targets has been a major factor hindering research in this exciting emerging area. For any such compiler, \"getting right\" the mechanics involved in state transformation upon migration and doing this efficiently is of critical importance. In particular, any runtime conversion of the current program stack from one architecture to another would be prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we design and develop Unifico, a new multi-ISA compiler that generates binaries that maintain the same stack layout during their execution on either architecture. Unifico avoids the need for runtime stack transformation, thus eliminating overheads associated with ISA migration. Additional responsibilities of the Unifico compiler backend include maintenance of a uniform ABI and virtual address space across ISAs. Unifico is implemented using the LLVM compiler infrastructure, and we are currently targeting the x86-64 and ARMv8 ISAs. We have evaluated Unifico across a range of compute-intensive NAS benchmarks and show its minimal impact on overall execution time, where less than 6% (10%) overhead is introduced on average for high-end (low-end) processors. We also analyze the performance impact of Unifico's key design features and demonstrate that they can be further optimized to mitigate this impact.

Understanding how foundation model (FM) agents understand and act in such environments is therefore critical for enabling reliable map-based reasoning and applications. However, most existing evaluations of spatial ability in FMs rely on static map inputs or text-based queries, overlooking the interactive and experience-driven nature of spatial understanding.In this paper, we propose an interactive evaluation framework to analyze how FM agents explore, remember, and reason in symbolic map environments. Agents incrementally explore partially observable grid-based maps consisting of roads, intersections, and points of interest (POIs), receiving only local observations at each step. Spatial understanding is then evaluated using six kinds of spatial tasks. By systematically varying exploration strategies, memory representations, and reasoning schemes across multiple foundation models, we reveal distinct functional roles of these components. Exploration primarily affects experience acquisition but has a limited impact on final reasoning accuracy. In contrast, memory representation plays a central role in consolidating spatial experience, with structured memories particularly sequential and graph-based representations, substantially improving performance on structure-intensive tasks such as path planning. Reasoning schemes further shape how stored spatial knowledge is used, with advanced prompts supporting more effective multi-step inference. We further observe that spatial reasoning performance saturates across model versions and scales beyond a certain capability threshold, indicating that improvements in map-based spatial understanding require mechanisms tailored to spatial representation and reasoning rather than scaling alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

DeepSeek-V3 has the best performance in all three categories of Calculus, Analytic Geometry, and Discrete Mathematics, both in reasoning and correct final answers. All three LLMs exhibited notably weak performance in Geometry. The majority of errors made by DeepSeek-V3 were attributed to computational and logical mistakes, whereas GPT-4o-mini frequently exhibited logical and approach-related errors. Gemini, on the other hand, tended to struggle with incomplete reasoning and drawing rushed conclusions.

Recent approaches leveraging large language models (LLMs) have shown promise but face limitations. Most rely solely on static analysis, ignoring runtime behaviors. Some attempt to incorporate dynamic signals, but these are often restricted to training or fine-tuning, or injected only once into the repair prompt, without iterative use. This fails to fully capture program execution. Current iterative repair frameworks typically rely on coarse-grained feedback, such as pass/fail results or exception types, and do not leverage fine-grained execution-level information effectively. As a result, models struggle to simulate human stepwise debugging, limiting their effectiveness in multi-step reasoning and complex bug repair.\n  To address these challenges, we propose DynaFix, an execution-level dynamic information-driven APR method that iteratively leverages runtime information to refine the repair process. In each repair round, DynaFix captures execution-level dynamic information such as variable states, control-flow paths, and call stacks, transforming them into structured prompts to guide LLMs in generating candidate patches. If a patch fails validation, DynaFix re-executes the modified program to collect new execution information for the next attempt. This iterative loop incrementally improves patches based on updated feedback, similar to the stepwise debugging practices of human developers. We evaluate DynaFix on the Defects4J v1.2 and v2.0 benchmarks. DynaFix repairs 186 single-function bugs, a 10% improvement over state-of-the-art baselines, including 38 bugs previously unrepaired.

CellSecInspector extracts structured state-condition-action (SCA) representations, models mobile network procedures with comprehensive function chains, systematically validates them against 9 foundational security properties under 4 adversarial scenarios, and automatically generates test cases. This end-to-end pipeline enables the automated discovery of vulnerabilities without relying on manually predefined security requirements or rules. Applying CellSecInspector to the well-studied 5G and 4G NAS and RRC specifications, it discovers 43 vulnerabilities, 8 of which are previously unreported. Our findings show that CellSecInspector is a scalable, adaptive, and effective solution to assess 3GPP specifications for safeguarding operational and next-generation cellular networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While large language models possess broad domain knowledge, they often fail to capture dataset-specific patterns critical for prediction tasks. Our approach addresses this by discovering semantic feature descriptions through an iterative process that contrasts groups of items identified via statistical modeling errors, rather than relying solely on the foundational model's domain understanding. We formulate this as a generalized EM algorithm that jointly optimizes semantic feature descriptors and statistical model parameters. The method prompts a frozen foundational model to classify items based on discovered features, treating these judgments as noisy observations of latent binary features that predict real-valued targets through learned statistical relationships. We demonstrate the approach on two domains: house price prediction (hedonic regression) and cold-start collaborative filtering for movie recommendations. On house prices, our model achieves 12\\% median relative error using discovered semantic features from multimodal listing data, substantially outperforming a GPT-5 baseline (38\\% error) that relies on the LLM's general domain knowledge. For Netflix movie embeddings, our model predicts collaborative filtering representations with 0.59 cosine similarity purely from semantic descriptions -- matching the performance that would require approximately 4000 user ratings through traditional collaborative filtering.

This dynamic frequently gives rise to previously unknown attacks that can circumvent current detection and prevention. This necessitates the continual updating of security mechanisms. Constructing generative AI with provable security and theoretically controllable risk is therefore necessary. Consensus Sampling (CS) is a promising algorithm toward provably secure AI. It controls risk by leveraging overlap in model output probabilities. However, we find that CS relies on frequent abstention to avoid unsafe outputs, which reduces utility. Moreover, CS becomes highly vulnerable when unsafe models are maliciously manipulated. To address these issues, we propose a new primitive called Reliable Consensus Sampling (RCS), that traces acceptance probability to tolerate extreme adversarial behaviors, improving robustness. RCS also eliminates the need for abstention entirely. We further develop a feedback algorithm to continuously and dynamically enhance the safety of RCS. We provide theoretical guarantees that RCS maintains a controllable risk threshold. Extensive experiments show that RCS significantly improves robustness and utility while maintaining latency comparable to CS.
