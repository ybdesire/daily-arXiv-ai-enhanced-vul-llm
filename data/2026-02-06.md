Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for code generation. However, the correctness of code generated by LLMs remains a concern. A potential remedy to this concern is to have LLMs generate formal correctness proofs along with such code. However, compared with code generation, code-proof generation requires much higher reasoning capability and has much less existing data to learn from. In this paper, we present VeruSyn, a data synthesis pipeline for Verus, a state-of-the-art verification tool for system software written in Rust. Through self-synthesis and tutorial-based synthesis, VeruSyn achieves much larger scale and Verus-feature coverage than previous data-synthesis techniques designed for Verus; VeruSyn also supplements its dataset with long-chain-of-thought (CoT) data through agent trajectory synthesis. With VeruSyn, we synthesize the largest set of Verus verified programs: 6.9 million Rust programs, each with a formal specification and a proof that it meets that specification. This dataset lets us create a fine-tuned Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct model with appealing cost-proof tradeoff compared with state-of-the-art commercial models like Claude Sonnet 4.5. It also significantly outperforms models like o4-mini and previously proposed research models.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: For real-world deployment of general-purpose LLM agents, the core challenge is often not tool use itself, but efficient domain adaptation under rapidly evolving toolsets, APIs, and protocols. Repeated LoRA or SFT across domains incurs exponentially growing training and maintenance costs, while prompt or schema methods are brittle under distribution shift and complex interfaces. We propose \textbf{Activation Steering Adapter (ASA}), a lightweight, inference-time, training-free mechanism that reads routing signals from intermediate activations and uses an ultra-light router to produce adaptive control strengths for precise domain alignment. Across multiple model scales and domains, ASA achieves LoRA-comparable adaptation with substantially lower overhead and strong cross-model transferability, making it ideally practical for robust, scalable, and efficient multi-domain tool ecosystems with frequent interface churn dynamics.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence attracts significant attention, especially with the introduction of large language models. Its capabilities are being exploited to solve various software engineering tasks. Thanks to their ability to understand natural language and generate natural language responses, large language models are great for processing various software documentation artifacts. At the same time, large language models excel at understanding structured languages, having the potential for working with software programs and models. We conduct a literature review on the usage of large language models for software engineering tasks related to documentation and modeling. We analyze articles from four major venues in the area, organize them per tasks they solve, and provide an overview of used prompt techniques, metrics, approaches to human-based evaluation, and major datasets.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML)-enabled systems challenge traditional Requirements Engineering (RE) and agile management due to data dependence, experimentation, and uncertain model behavior. Existing RE and agile practices remain poorly integrated and insufficiently tailored to these characteristics. This paper reports on the practical experience of applying RefineML, a requirements-focused approach for the continuous and agile refinement of ML-enabled systems, which integrates ML-tailored specification and agile management approaches with best practices derived from a systematic mapping study. The application context concerns an industry-academia collaboration project between PUC-Rio and EXA, a Brazilian cybersecurity company. For evaluation purposes, we applied questionnaires assessing RefineML's suitability and overall acceptance and semi-structured interviews. We applied thematic analysis to the collected qualitative data. Regarding suitability and acceptance, the results of the questionnaires indicated high perceived usefulness and intention to use. Based on the interviews, stakeholders perceived RefineML as improving communication and facilitating early feasibility assessments, as well as enabling dual-track governance of ML and software work, allowing continuous refinement of the model while evolving the overall software project. However, some limitations remain, particularly related to difficulties in operationalizing ML concerns into agile requirements and in estimating ML effort.

Abstract: Despite increased adoption and advances in machine learning (ML), there are studies showing that many ML prototypes do not reach the production stage and that testing is still largely limited to testing model properties, such as model performance, without considering requirements derived from the system it will be a part of, such as throughput, resource consumption, or robustness. This limited view of testing leads to failures in model integration, deployment, and operations. In traditional software development, quality models such as ISO 25010 provide a widely used structured framework to assess software quality, define quality requirements, and provide a common language for communication with stakeholders. A newer standard, ISO 25059, defines a more specific quality model for AI systems. However, a problem with this standard is that it combines system attributes with ML component attributes, which is not helpful for a model developer, as many system attributes cannot be assessed at the component level. In this paper, we present a quality model for ML components that serves as a guide for requirements elicitation and negotiation and provides a common vocabulary for ML component developers and system stakeholders to agree on and define system-derived requirements and focus their testing efforts accordingly. The quality model was validated through a survey in which the participants agreed with its relevance and value. The quality model has been successfully integrated into an open-source tool for ML component testing and evaluation demonstrating its practical application.

Abstract: Unittest and pytest are the most popular testing frameworks in Python. Overall, pytest provides some advantages, including simpler assertion, reuse of fixtures, and interoperability. Due to such benefits, multiple projects in the Python ecosystem have migrated from unittest to pytest. To facilitate the migration, pytest can also run unittest tests, thus, the migration can happen gradually over time. However, the migration can be time-consuming and take a long time to conclude. In this context, projects would benefit from automated solutions to support the migration process. In this paper, we propose TestMigrationsInPy, a dataset of test migrations from unittest to pytest. TestMigrationsInPy contains 923 real-world migrations performed by developers. Future research proposing novel solutions to migrate frameworks in Python can rely on TestMigrationsInPy as a ground truth. Moreover, as TestMigrationsInPy includes information about the migration type (e.g., changes in assertions or fixtures), our dataset enables novel solutions to be verified effectively, for instance, from simpler assertion migrations to more complex fixture migrations. TestMigrationsInPy is publicly available at: https://github.com/altinoalvesjunior/TestMigrationsInPy.

Abstract: Exceptions allow developers to handle error cases expected to occur infrequently. Ideally, good test suites should test both normal and exceptional behaviors to catch more bugs and avoid regressions. While current research analyzes exceptions that propagate to tests, it does not explore other exceptions that do not reach the tests. In this paper, we provide an empirical study to explore how frequently exceptional behaviors are tested in real-world systems. We consider both exceptions that propagate to tests and the ones that do not reach the tests. For this purpose, we run an instrumented version of test suites, monitor their execution, and collect information about the exceptions raised at runtime. We analyze the test suites of 25 Python systems, covering 5,372 executed methods, 17.9M calls, and 1.4M raised exceptions. We find that 21.4% of the executed methods do raise exceptions at runtime. In methods that raise exceptions, on the median, 1 in 10 calls exercise exceptional behaviors. Close to 80% of the methods that raise exceptions do so infrequently, but about 20% raise exceptions more frequently. Finally, we provide implications for researchers and practitioners. We suggest developing novel tools to support exercising exceptional behaviors and refactoring expensive try/except blocks. We also call attention to the fact that exception-raising behaviors are not necessarily "abnormal" or rare.

Abstract: The intersection of Safety of Intended Functionality (SOTIF) and Functional Safety (FuSa) analysis of driving automation features has traditionally excluded Quality Management (QM) components from rigorous safety impact evaluations. While QM components are not typically classified as safety-relevant, recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) integration reveal that such components can contribute to SOTIF-related hazardous risks. Compliance with emerging AI safety standards, such as ISO/PAS 8800, necessitates re-evaluating safety considerations for these components. This paper examines the necessity of conducting holistic safety analysis and risk assessment on AI components, emphasizing their potential to introduce hazards with the capacity to violate risk acceptance criteria when deployed in safety-critical driving systems, particularly in perception algorithms. Using case studies, we demonstrate how deficiencies in AI-driven perception systems can emerge even in QM-classified components, leading to unintended functional behaviors with critical safety implications. By bridging theoretical analysis with practical examples, this paper argues for the adoption of comprehensive FuSa, SOTIF, and AI standards-driven methodologies to identify and mitigate risks in AI components. The findings demonstrate the importance of revising existing safety frameworks to address the evolving challenges posed by AI, ensuring comprehensive safety assurance across all component classifications spanning multiple safety standards.

Abstract: Agentic Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has delivered state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on complex software engineering tasks such as code generation and bug fixing. However, its practical adoption remains limited due to significant computational overhead, primarily driven by two key challenges: (1) the high cost associated with deploying excessively large ensembles, and (2) the lack of a reliable mechanism for selecting the optimal candidate solution, ultimately constraining the performance gains that can be realized. To address these challenges, we propose Entropy-Guided Stepwise Scaling (EGSS), a novel TTS framework that dynamically balances efficiency and effectiveness through entropy-guided adaptive search and robust test-suite augmentation. Extensive experiments on SWE-Bench-Verified demonstrate that EGSS consistently boosts performance by 5-10% across all evaluated models. Specifically, it increases the resolved ratio of Kimi-K2-Intruct from 63.2% to 72.2%, and GLM-4.6 from 65.8% to 74.6%. Furthermore, when paired with GLM-4.6, EGSS achieves a new state-of-the-art among open-source large language models. In addition to these accuracy improvements, EGSS reduces inference-time token usage by over 28% compared to existing TTS methods, achieving simultaneous gains in both effectiveness and computational efficiency.

Abstract: As software systems evolve, patches may unintentionally alter program behavior. Validating patches against their intended semantics is difficult due to incomplete regression tests and informal, non-executable natural language (NL) descriptions of patch intent. We present PatchGuru, the first automated technique that infers executable patch specifications from real-world pull requests (PRs). Given a PR, PatchGuru uses large language models (LLMs) to extract developer intent from NL artifacts and synthesizes patch oracles: under-approximate yet practical specifications expressed as runtime assertions in comparison programs that integrate pre- and post-patch versions. Patch oracles focus on patch-relevant behaviors, enable automated validation, and support cross-version properties. PatchGuru iteratively refines inferred oracles by comparing pre- and post-patch behaviors, identifies violations, filters inconsistencies via self-review, and generates bug reports. We evaluate PatchGuru on 400 recent PRs from four widely used open-source Python projects. PatchGuru reports 39 warnings with a precision of 0.62, yielding 24 confirmed true positives, including 12 previously unknown bugs, 11 of which were subsequently fixed by developers. Compared to the state-of-the-art technique Testora, PatchGuru detects 17 more bugs (24 vs. 7) while improving precision from 0.32 to 0.62. PatchGuru incurs an average cost of 8.9 minutes and USD 0.07 per PR. These results suggest that PatchGuru complements code review and regression testing by providing executable documentation and automated validation of patch intent.

Abstract: Fuzzing has become a popular technique for automatically detecting vulnerabilities and bugs by generating unexpected inputs. In recent years, the fuzzing process has been integrated into continuous integration workflows (i.e., continuous fuzzing), enabling short and frequent testing cycles. Despite its widespread adoption, prior research has not examined whether the effectiveness of continuous fuzzing varies across programming languages. This study conducts a large-scale cross-language analysis to examine how fuzzing bug characteristics and detection efficiency differ among languages. We analyze 61,444 fuzzing bugs and 999,248 builds from 559 OSS-Fuzz projects categorized by primary language. Our findings reveal that (i) C++ and Rust exhibit higher fuzzing bug detection frequencies, (ii) Rust and Python show low vulnerability ratios but tend to expose more critical vulnerabilities, (iii) crash types vary across languages and unreproducible bugs are more frequent in Go but rare in Rust, and (iv) Python attains higher patch coverage but suffers from longer time-to-detection. These results demonstrate that fuzzing behavior and effectiveness are strongly shaped by language design, providing insights for language-aware fuzzing strategies and tool development.

Abstract: SLO-as-code has made per-service} reliability declarative, but user experience is defined by journeys whose reliability is an emergent property of microservice topology, routing, redundancy, timeouts/fallbacks, shared failure domains, and tail amplification. As a result, journey objectives (e.g., "checkout p99 < 400 ms") are often maintained outside code and drift as the system evolves, forcing teams to either miss user expectations or over-provision and gate releases with ad-hoc heuristics. We propose Emergence-as-Code (EmaC), a vision for making journey reliability computable and governable via intent plus evidence. An EmaC spec declares journey intent (objective, control-flow operators, allowed actions) and binds it to atomic SLOs and telemetry. A runtime inference component consumes operational artifacts (e.g., tracing and traffic configuration) to synthesize a candidate journey model with provenance and confidence. From the last accepted model, the EmaC compiler/controller derives bounded journey SLOs and budgets under explicit correlation assumptions (optimistic independence vs. pessimistic shared fate), and emits control-plane artifacts (burn-rate alerts, rollout gates, action guards) that are reviewable in a Git workflow. An anonymized artifact repository provides a runnable example specification and generated outputs.

Abstract: Flaky tests yield inconsistent results when they are repeatedly executed on the same code revision. They interfere with automated quality assurance of code changes and hinder efficient software testing. Previous work evaluated approaches to train machine learning models to classify flaky tests based on identifiers in the test code. However, the resulting classifiers have been shown to lack generalizability, hindering their applicability in practical environments. Recently, pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown the capability to generalize across various tasks. Thus, they represent a promising approach to address the generalizability problem of previous approaches. In this study, we evaluated three LLMs (two general-purpose models, one code-specific model) using three prompting techniques on two benchmark datasets from prior studies on flaky test classification. Furthermore, we manually investigated 50 samples from the given datasets to determine whether classifying flaky tests based only on test code is feasible for humans. Our findings indicate that LLMs struggle to classify flaky tests given only the test code. The results of our best prompt-model combination were only marginally better than random guessing. In our manual analysis, we found that the test code does not necessarily contain sufficient information for a flakiness classification. Our findings motivate future work to evaluate LLMs for flakiness classification with additional context, for example, using retrieval-augmented generation or agentic AI.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Digital sovereignty has emerged as a central concern for modern software-intensive systems, driven by the dominance of non-sovereign cloud infrastructures, the rapid adoption of Generative AI, and increasingly stringent regulatory requirements. While existing initiatives address governance, compliance, and security in isolation, they provide limited guidance on how sovereignty can be operationalized at the architectural level. In this paper, we argue that sovereignty must be treated as a first-class architectural property rather than a purely regulatory objective. We introduce a Sovereign Reference Architecture that integrates self-sovereign identity, blockchain-based trust and auditability, sovereign data governance, and Generative AI deployed under explicit architectural control. The architecture explicitly captures the dual role of Generative AI as both a source of governance risk and an enabler of compliance, accountability, and continuous assurance when properly constrained. By framing sovereignty as an architectural quality attribute, our work bridges regulatory intent and concrete system design, offering a coherent foundation for building auditable, evolvable, and jurisdiction-aware AI-enabled systems. The proposed reference architecture provides a principled starting point for future research and practice at the intersection of software architecture, Generative AI, and digital sovereignty.

Abstract: Agentic large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on cybersecurity tasks using capture-the-flag (CTF) benchmarks. However, existing pointwise benchmarks have limited ability to shed light on the robustness and generalisation abilities of agents across alternative versions of the source code. We introduce CTF challenge families, whereby a single CTF is used as the basis for generating a family of semantically-equivalent challenges via semantics-preserving program transformations. This enables controlled evaluation of agent robustness to source code transformations while keeping the underlying exploit strategy fixed. We introduce a new tool, Evolve-CTF, that generates CTF families from Python challenges using a range of transformations. Using Evolve-CTF to derive families from Cybench and Intercode challenges, we evaluate 13 agentic LLM configurations with tool access. We find that models are remarkably robust to intrusive renaming and code insertion-based transformations, but that composed transformations and deeper obfuscation affect performance by requiring more sophisticated use of tools. We also find that enabling explicit reasoning has little effect on solution success rates across challenge families. Our work contributes a valuable technique and tool for future LLM evaluations, and a large dataset characterising the capabilities of current state-of-the-art models in this domain.

Abstract: ArkTS is a core programming language in the OpenHarmony ecosystem, yet research on ArkTS code intelligence is hindered by the lack of public datasets and evaluation benchmarks. This paper presents a large-scale ArkTS dataset constructed from open-source repositories, targeting code retrieval and code evaluation tasks. We design a single-search task, where natural language comments are used to retrieve corresponding ArkTS functions. ArkTS repositories are crawled from GitHub and Gitee, and comment-function pairs are extracted using tree-sitter-arkts, followed by cross-platform deduplication and statistical analysis of ArkTS function types. We further evaluate all existing open-source code embedding models on the single-search task and perform fine-tuning using both ArkTS and TypeScript training datasets, resulting in a high-performing model for ArkTS code understanding. This work establishes the first systematic benchmark for ArkTS code retrieval. Both the dataset and our fine-tuned model will be released publicly and are available at https://huggingface.co/hreyulog/embedinggemma_arkts and https://huggingface.co/datasets/hreyulog/arkts-code-docstring,establishing the first systematic benchmark for ArkTS code retrieval.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Context: AI-assisted tools are increasingly integrated into software development workflows, but their reliance on large language models (LLMs) introduces substantial computational and energy costs. Understanding and reducing the energy footprint of LLM inference is therefore essential for sustainable software development. Objective: In this study, we conduct a phase-level analysis of LLM inference energy consumption, distinguishing between the (1) prefill, where the model processes the input and builds internal representations, and (2) decoding, where output tokens are generated using the stored state. Method: We investigate six 6B-7B and four 3B-4B transformer-based models, evaluating them on code-centric benchmarks HumanEval for code generation and LongBench for code understanding. Results: Our findings show that, within both parameter groups, models exhibit distinct energy patterns across phases. Furthermore, we observed that increases in prefill cost amplify the energy cost per token during decoding, with amplifications ranging from 1.3% to 51.8% depending on the model. Lastly, three out of ten models demonstrate babbling behavior, adding excessive content to the output that unnecessarily inflates energy consumption. We implemented babbling suppression for code generation, achieving energy savings ranging from 44% to 89% without affecting generation accuracy. Conclusion: These findings show that prefill costs influence decoding, which dominates energy consumption, and that babbling suppression can yield up to 89% energy savings. Reducing inference energy therefore requires both mitigating babbling behavior and limiting impact of prefill on decoding.

Abstract: Automated vulnerability reproduction from CVE descriptions requires generating executable Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploits and validating them in target environments. This process is critical in software security research and practice, yet remains time-consuming and demands specialized expertise when performed manually. While LLM agents show promise for automating this task, existing approaches often conflate exploring attack directions with fixing implementation details, which leads to unproductive debugging loops when reproduction fails. To address this, we propose Cve2PoC, an LLM-based dual-loop agent framework following a plan-execute-evaluate paradigm. The Strategic Planner analyzes vulnerability semantics and target code to produce structured attack plans. The Tactical Executor generates PoC code and validates it through progressive verification. The Adaptive Refiner evaluates execution results and routes failures to different loops: the \textit{Tactical Loop} for code-level refinement, while the \textit{Strategic Loop} for attack strategy replanning. This dual-loop design enables the framework to escape ineffective debugging by matching remediation to failure type. Evaluation on two benchmarks covering 617 real-world vulnerabilities demonstrates that Cve2PoC achieves 82.9\% and 54.3\% reproduction success rates on SecBench.js and PatchEval, respectively, outperforming the best baseline by 11.3\% and 20.4\%. Human evaluation confirms that generated PoCs achieve comparable code quality to human-written exploits in readability and reusability.

Abstract: Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM), commonly known as energy disaggregation, aims to estimate the power consumption of individual appliances by analyzing a home's total electricity usage. This method provides a cost-effective alternative to installing dedicated smart meters for each appliance. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that incorporates Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) into the NILM domain, utilizing Bayesian Optimization for automated model selection and hyperparameter tuning. This framework empowers domain practitioners to effectively apply machine learning techniques without requiring advanced expertise in data science or machine learning. To support further research and industry adoption, we present AutoML4NILM, a flexible and extensible open-source toolkit designed to streamline the deployment of AutoML solutions for energy disaggregation. Currently, this framework supports 11 algorithms, each with different hyperparameters; however, its flexible design allows for the extension of both the algorithms and their hyperparameters.

Abstract: The quantum threat to cybersecurity has accelerated the standardization of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). Migrating legacy software to these quantum-safe algorithms is not a simple library swap, but a new software engineering challenge: existing vulnerability detection, refactoring, and testing tools are not designed for PQC's probabilistic behavior, side-channel sensitivity, and complex performance trade-offs. To address these challenges, this paper outlines a vision for a new class of tools and introduces the Automated Quantum-safe Adaptation (AQuA) framework, with a three-pillar agenda for PQC-aware detection, semantic refactoring, and hybrid verification, thereby motivating Quantum-Safe Software Engineering (QSSE) as a distinct research direction.

Despite the increased performance of LLMs on public benchmarks, out of the box LLMs still have a hard time generating code that aligns with a private code repository not previously seen by the model's training data. Customizing code LLMs to a private repository provides a way to improve the model performance. In this paper we present our approach for automated LLM customization based on semantic scopes in the code. We evaluate LLMs on real industry cases with two private enterprise code repositories with two customization strategies: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and supervised Fine-Tuning (FT). Our mechanism for ingesting the repository's data and formulating the training data pairs with semantic scopes helps models to learn the underlying patterns specific to the repository, providing more precise code to developers and helping to boost their productivity. The code completions of moderately sized customized models can be significantly better than those of uncustomized models of much larger capacity. We also include an analysis of customization on two public benchmarks and present opportunities for future work.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve breakthroughs in complex reasoning, Codeforces-based Elo ratings have emerged as a prominent metric for evaluating competitive programming capabilities. However, these ratings are often reported without critical experimental details, leading to significant discrepancies illustrated by recent reports where the score of the same model version fluctuated by nearly 500 points. This paper presents a systematic empirical study on the hidden factors biasing Elo evaluations: (1) the temporal ordering of submissions, (2) contest difficulty selection, and (3) run to run stochastic variability of LLMs. Utilizing a controlled benchmark of 37 recent Codeforces contests and 13,691 generated test cases, we demonstrate that Elo scores are highly sensitive to these parameters. Our findings reveal that varying submission orders can shift scores by 394 points, while contest selection can cause differences of up to 1,122 points for the same model. Run to run performance exhibits substantial instability, with a maximum difference of 349 points in mean scores observed when evaluating identical contests. We conclude that direct Elo comparisons are unreliable and potentially misleading without strict standardization and transparent reporting of experimental settings.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly used for code generation, but their outputs often follow recurring templates that can induce predictable vulnerabilities. We study \emph{vulnerability persistence} in LLM-generated software and introduce \emph{Feature--Security Table (FSTab)} with two components. First, FSTab enables a black-box attack that predicts likely backend vulnerabilities from observable frontend features and knowledge of the source LLM, without access to backend code or source code. Second, FSTab provides a model-centric evaluation that quantifies how consistently a given model reproduces the same vulnerabilities across programs, semantics-preserving rephrasings, and application domains. We evaluate FSTab on state-of-the-art code LLMs, including GPT-5.2, Claude-4.5 Opus, and Gemini-3 Pro, across diverse application domains. Our results show strong cross-domain transfer: even when the target domain is excluded from training, FSTab achieves up to 94\% attack success and 93\% vulnerability coverage on Internal Tools (Claude-4.5 Opus). These findings expose an underexplored attack surface in LLM-generated software and highlight the security risks of code generation. Our code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FSTab-024E.

Abstract: We study privacy amplification by synthetic data release, a phenomenon in which differential privacy guarantees are improved by releasing only synthetic data rather than the private generative model itself. Recent work by Pierquin et al. (2025) established the first formal amplification guarantees for a linear generator, but they apply only in asymptotic regimes where the model dimension far exceeds the number of released synthetic records, limiting their practical relevance. In this work, we show a surprising result: under a bounded-parameter assumption, privacy amplification persists even when releasing an unbounded number of synthetic records, thereby improving upon the bounds of Pierquin et al. (2025). Our analysis provides structural insights that may guide the development of tighter privacy guarantees for more complex release mechanisms.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models are widely adopted for their strong generative capabilities, yet remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Existing attacks typically rely on fixed textual triggers and single-entity backdoor targets, making them highly susceptible to enumeration-based input defenses and attention-consistency detection. In this work, we propose Semantic-level Backdoor Attack (SemBD), which implants backdoors at the representation level by defining triggers as continuous semantic regions rather than discrete textual patterns. Concretely, SemBD injects semantic backdoors by distillation-based editing of the key and value projection matrices in cross-attention layers, enabling diverse prompts with identical semantic compositions to reliably activate the backdoor attack. To further enhance stealthiness, SemBD incorporates a semantic regularization to prevent unintended activation under incomplete semantics, as well as multi-entity backdoor targets that avoid highly consistent cross-attention patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SemBD achieves a 100% attack success rate while maintaining strong robustness against state-of-the-art input-level defenses.

Abstract: We present a data poisoning attack -- Phantom Transfer -- with the property that, even if you know precisely how the poison was placed into an otherwise benign dataset, you cannot filter it out. We achieve this by modifying subliminal learning to work in real-world contexts and demonstrate that the attack works across models, including GPT-4.1. Indeed, even fully paraphrasing every sample in the dataset using a different model does not stop the attack. We also discuss connections to steering vectors and show that one can plant password-triggered behaviours into models while still beating defences.
  This suggests that data-level defences are insufficient for stopping sophisticated data poisoning attacks. We suggest that future work should focus on model audits and white-box security methods.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems introduce complex privacy risks throughout their lifecycle, especially when processing sensitive or high-dimensional data. Beyond the seven traditional privacy threat categories defined by the LINDDUN framework, AI systems are also exposed to model-centric privacy attacks such as membership inference and model inversion, which LINDDUN does not cover. To address both classical LINDDUN threats and additional AI-driven privacy attacks, PriMod4AI introduces a hybrid privacy threat modeling approach that unifies two structured knowledge sources, a LINDDUN knowledge base representing the established taxonomy, and a model-centric privacy attack knowledge base capturing threats outside LINDDUN. These knowledge bases are embedded into a vector database for semantic retrieval and combined with system level metadata derived from Data Flow Diagram. PriMod4AI uses retrieval-augmented and Data Flow specific prompt generation to guide large language models (LLMs) in identifying, explaining, and categorizing privacy threats across lifecycle stages. The framework produces justified and taxonomy-grounded threat assessments that integrate both classical and AI-driven perspectives. Evaluation on two AI systems indicates that PriMod4AI provides broad coverage of classical privacy categories while additionally identifying model-centric privacy threats. The framework produces consistent, knowledge-grounded outputs across LLMs, as reflected in agreement scores in the observed range.

Abstract: Future AI deployments will likely be monitored for malicious behaviour. The ability of these AIs to subvert monitors by adversarially selecting against them - attack selection - is particularly concerning. To study this, we let a red team create attack policies that attempt to insert attacks into code without being caught by a monitor in the concentrated BigCodeBench backdooring setting. We decompose attack selection into two problems: mapping attacks to a quality score and mapping quality scores to submission probabilities. We frame attack selection as a classification problem and show that safety is significantly more sensitive to FPR than TPR. We find that prompting the attacker model to reason about the monitor while being cautious with attack selection reduces safety from a baseline of 99% to 59% at 0.5% auditing budget, emphasizing that eliciting attack selection capabilities of models is vital to avoid overly optimistic safety scores in control evaluations.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI systems has collapsed the credibility landscape for photographic evidence. Modern image generation models produce photorealistic images undermining the evidentiary foundation upon which journalism and public discourse depend. Existing authentication approaches, such as the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA), embed cryptographically signed metadata directly into image files but suffer from two critical failures: technical vulnerability to metadata stripping during social media reprocessing, and structural dependency on corporate-controlled verification infrastructure where commercial incentives may conflict with public interest. We present the Birthmark Standard, an authentication architecture leveraging manufacturing-unique sensor entropy from non-uniformity correction (NUC) maps and PRNU patterns to generate hardware-rooted authentication keys. During capture, cameras create anonymized authentication certificates proving sensor authenticity without exposing device identity via a key table architecture maintaining anonymity sets exceeding 1,000 devices. Authentication records are stored on a consortium blockchain operated by journalism organizations rather than commercial platforms, enabling verification that survives all metadata loss. We formally verify privacy properties using ProVerif, proving observational equivalence for Manufacturer Non-Correlation and Blockchain Observer Non-Identification under Dolev-Yao adversary assumptions. The architecture is validated through prototype implementation using Raspberry Pi 4 hardware, demonstrating the complete cryptographic pipeline. Performance analysis projects camera overhead below 100ms and verification latency below 500ms at scale of one million daily authentications.

Abstract: The landscape of synthetic media has been irrevocably altered by text-to-video (T2V) models, whose outputs are rapidly approaching indistinguishability from reality. Critically, this technology is no longer confined to large-scale labs; the proliferation of efficient, open-source generators is democratizing the ability to create high-fidelity synthetic content on consumer-grade hardware. This makes existing face-centric and manipulation-based benchmarks obsolete. To address this urgent threat, we introduce SynthForensics, to the best of our knowledge the first human-centric benchmark for detecting purely synthetic video deepfakes. The benchmark comprises 6,815 unique videos from five architecturally distinct, state-of-the-art open-source T2V models. Its construction was underpinned by a meticulous two-stage, human-in-the-loop validation to ensure high semantic and visual quality. Each video is provided in four versions (raw, lossless, light, and heavy compression) to enable real-world robustness testing. Experiments demonstrate that state-of-the-art detectors are both fragile and exhibit limited generalization when evaluated on this new domain: we observe a mean performance drop of $29.19\%$ AUC, with some methods performing worse than random chance, and top models losing over 30 points under heavy compression. The paper further investigates the efficacy of training on SynthForensics as a means to mitigate these observed performance gaps, achieving robust generalization to unseen generators ($93.81\%$ AUC), though at the cost of reduced backward compatibility with traditional manipulation-based deepfakes. The complete dataset and all generation metadata, including the specific prompts and inference parameters for every video, will be made publicly available at [link anonymized for review].

Abstract: As RISC-V adoption accelerates, domains such as automotive, the Internet of Things (IoT), and industrial control are attracting growing attention. These domains are subject to stringent Size, Weight, Power, and Cost (SWaP-C) constraints, which have driven a shift toward heterogeneous Systems-on-Chip (SoCs) integrating general-purpose CPUs, tightly coupled accelerators, and diverse I/O devices with different integrity levels. While such integration improves cost efficiency and performance, it introduces a fundamental safety and security challenge: enforcing system-level isolation in mixed-criticality environments. Although RISC-V International has proposed several hardware isolation primitives, including RISC-V Worlds, IOPMP, and SmMTT, their interoperability, scalability, and suitability for real-time systems remain insufficiently understood. In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of these primitives from the perspective of practical heterogeneous SoC designs. We implement an IOPMP, a World-based checker, and a modified RISC-V World checker that addresses key limitations of the baseline specification, and evaluate their trade-offs in terms of security guarantees and power-performance-area (PPA). Our results show that the World-based checker introduces a fixed, configuration-independent access latency, achieving lower worst-case delay than the evaluated alternatives while scaling predictably with system size. At the macro level, we estimate that the proposed modifications reduce SoC area by up to approximately 5% compared to a baseline design. All artifacts will be released as open source, and we expect these findings to directly contribute to the evolution and ratification of RISC-V specifications, as well as to the design of future RISC-V SoCs.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in image geolocation, a capability further sharpened by frontier multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs). This poses a significant privacy risk, as these widely accessible models can be exploited to infer sensitive locations from casually shared photos, often at street-level precision, potentially surpassing the level of detail the sharer consented or intended to disclose. While recent work has proposed applying a blanket restriction on geolocation disclosure to combat this risk, these measures fail to distinguish valid geolocation uses from malicious behavior. Instead, VLMs should maintain contextual integrity by reasoning about elements within an image to determine the appropriate level of information disclosure, balancing privacy and utility. To evaluate how well models respect contextual integrity, we introduce VLM-GEOPRIVACY, a benchmark that challenges VLMs to interpret latent social norms and contextual cues in real-world images and determine the appropriate level of location disclosure. Our evaluation of 14 leading VLMs shows that, despite their ability to precisely geolocate images, the models are poorly aligned with human privacy expectations. They often over-disclose in sensitive contexts and are vulnerable to prompt-based attacks. Our results call for new design principles in multimodal systems to incorporate context-conditioned privacy reasoning.

Abstract: Online scams across email, short message services, and social media increasingly challenge everyday risk assessment, particularly as generative AI enables more fluent and context-aware deception. Although transformer-based detectors achieve strong predictive performance, their explanations are often opaque to non-experts or misaligned with model decisions. We propose VEXA, an evidence-grounded and persona-adaptive framework for generating learner-facing scam explanations by integrating GradientSHAP-based attribution with theory-informed vulnerability personas. Evaluation across multi-channel datasets shows that grounding explanations in detector-derived evidence improves semantic reliability without increasing linguistic complexity, while persona conditioning introduces interpretable stylistic variation without disrupting evidential alignment. These results reveal a key design insight: evidential grounding governs semantic correctness, whereas persona-based adaptation operates at the level of presentation under constraints of faithfulness. Together, VEXA demonstrates the feasibility of persona-adaptive, evidence-grounded explanations and provides design guidance for trustworthy, learner-facing security explanations in non-formal contexts.

Abstract: As AI agents automate critical workloads, they remain vulnerable to indirect prompt injection (IPI) attacks. Current defenses rely on monitoring protocols that jointly evaluate an agent's Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and tool-use actions to ensure alignment with user intent. We demonstrate that these monitoring-based defenses can be bypassed via a novel Agent-as-a-Proxy attack, where prompt injection attacks treat the agent as a delivery mechanism, bypassing both agent and monitor simultaneously. While prior work on scalable oversight has focused on whether small monitors can supervise large agents, we show that even frontier-scale monitors are vulnerable. Large-scale monitoring models like Qwen2.5-72B can be bypassed by agents with similar capabilities, such as GPT-4o mini and Llama-3.1-70B. On the AgentDojo benchmark, we achieve a high attack success rate against AlignmentCheck and Extract-and-Evaluate monitors under diverse monitoring LLMs. Our findings suggest current monitoring-based agentic defenses are fundamentally fragile regardless of model scale.

Abstract: Simulated environments are a key piece in the success of Reinforcement Learning (RL), allowing practitioners and researchers to train decision making agents without running expensive experiments on real hardware. Simulators remain a security blind spot, however, enabling adversarial developers to alter the dynamics of their released simulators for malicious purposes. Therefore, in this work we highlight a novel threat, demonstrating how simulator dynamics can be exploited to stealthily implant action-level backdoors into RL agents. The backdoor then allows an adversary to reliably activate targeted actions in an agent upon observing a predefined ``trigger'', leading to potentially dangerous consequences. Traditional backdoor attacks are limited in their strong threat models, assuming the adversary has near full control over an agent's training pipeline, enabling them to both alter and observe agent's rewards. As these assumptions are infeasible to implement within a simulator, we propose a new attack ``Daze'' which is able to reliably and stealthily implant backdoors into RL agents trained for real world tasks without altering or even observing their rewards. We provide formal proof of Daze's effectiveness in guaranteeing attack success across general RL tasks along with extensive empirical evaluations on both discrete and continuous action space domains. We additionally provide the first example of RL backdoor attacks transferring to real, robotic hardware. These developments motivate further research into securing all components of the RL training pipeline to prevent malicious attacks.

Abstract: Crypto-assets are a main segment of electronic markets, with growing trade volume and market share, yet there's no unified and comprehensive asset level taxonomy framework. This paper develops a multidimensional taxonomy for crypto-assets that connects technical design to market structure and regulation. Building on established taxonomy guideline and existing models, we derive dimensions from theory, regulatory frameworks, and case studies. We then map top 100 assets within the structure and provide several detailed case studies. The taxonomy covers technology standard, centralisation of critical resources, asset function, legal classification and mechanism designs of minting, yield, redemption. The asset mapping and case studies reveal recurring design patterns, capture features of edge cases that sit on boundaries of current categorisations, and document centralised control of nominal decentralised assets. This paper provides framework for systematic study for crypto markets, supports regulators in assessing token risks, and offers investors and digital platform designers a tool to compare assets when building or participate in electronic markets.

Abstract: Cyber attacks have become a serious threat to the security of software systems. Many organizations have built their security knowledge bases to safeguard against attacks and vulnerabilities. However, due to the time lag in the official release of security information, these security knowledge bases may not be well maintained, and using them to protect software systems against emergent security risks can be challenging. On the other hand, the security posts on online knowledge-sharing platforms contain many crowd security discussions and the knowledge in those posts can be used to enhance the security knowledge bases. This paper proposes SynAT, an automatic approach to synthesize attack trees from crowd security posts. Given a security post, SynAT first utilize the Large Language Model (LLM) and prompt learning to restrict the scope of sentences that may contain attack information; then it utilizes a transition-based event and relation extraction model to extract the events and relations simultaneously from the scope; finally, it applies heuristic rules to synthesize the attack trees with the extracted events and relations. An experimental evaluation is conducted on 5,070 Stack Overflow security posts, and the results show that SynAT outperforms all baselines in both event and relation extraction, and achieves the highest tree similarity in attack tree synthesis. Furthermore, SynAT has been applied to enhance HUAWEI's security knowledge base as well as public security knowledge bases CVE and CAPEC, which demonstrates SynAT's practicality.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) evolve into autonomous agents, their real-world applicability has expanded significantly, accompanied by new security challenges. Most existing agent defense mechanisms adopt a mandatory checking paradigm, in which security validation is forcibly triggered at predefined stages of the agent lifecycle. In this work, we argue that effective agent security should be intrinsic and selective rather than architecturally decoupled and mandatory. We propose Spider-Sense framework, an event-driven defense framework based on Intrinsic Risk Sensing (IRS), which allows agents to maintain latent vigilance and trigger defenses only upon risk perception. Once triggered, the Spider-Sense invokes a hierarchical defence mechanism that trades off efficiency and precision: it resolves known patterns via lightweight similarity matching while escalating ambiguous cases to deep internal reasoning, thereby eliminating reliance on external models. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce S$^2$Bench, a lifecycle-aware benchmark featuring realistic tool execution and multi-stage attacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Spider-Sense achieves competitive or superior defense performance, attaining the lowest Attack Success Rate (ASR) and False Positive Rate (FPR), with only a marginal latency overhead of 8.3\%.

Abstract: Chat template is a common technique used in the training and inference stages of Large Language Models (LLMs). It can transform input and output data into role-based and templated expressions to enhance the performance of LLMs. However, this also creates a breeding ground for novel attack surfaces. In this paper, we first reveal that the customizability of chat templates allows an attacker who controls the template to inject arbitrary strings into the system prompt without the user's notice. Building on this, we propose a training-free backdoor attack, termed BadTemplate. Specifically, BadTemplate inserts carefully crafted malicious instructions into the high-priority system prompt, thereby causing the target LLM to exhibit persistent backdoor behaviors. BadTemplate outperforms traditional backdoor attacks by embedding malicious instructions directly into the system prompt, eliminating the need for model retraining while achieving high attack effectiveness with minimal cost. Furthermore, its simplicity and scalability make it easily and widely deployed in real-world systems, raising serious risks of rapid propagation, economic damage, and large-scale misinformation. Furthermore, detection by major third-party platforms HuggingFace and LLM-as-a-judge proves largely ineffective against BadTemplate. Extensive experiments conducted on 5 benchmark datasets across 6 open-source and 3 closed-source LLMs, compared with 3 baselines, demonstrate that BadTemplate achieves up to a 100% attack success rate and significantly outperforms traditional prompt-based backdoors in both word-level and sentence-level attacks. Our work highlights the potential security risks raised by chat templates in the LLM supply chain, thereby supporting the development of effective defense mechanisms.

Abstract: Despite the advantages of decentralization and immutability, blockchain technology faces significant scalability and throughput limitations, which has prompted the exploration of off-chain solutions like payment channels. Adaptor signatures have been considered a promising primitive for constructing such channels due to their support for atomicity, offering an alternative to traditional hash-timelock contracts. However, standard adaptor signatures may reveal signer identity, raising potential privacy concerns. While ring signatures can mitigate this issue by providing anonymity, they often introduce high communication overhead, particularly in multi-account payment settings commonly used in UTXO-based blockchains like Monero. To address these limitations, we propose a Linkable Threshold Ring Adaptor Signature (LTRAS) scheme, which integrates the conditional binding of adaptor signatures, the multi-account payment of threshold ring signatures, and the linkability for preventing double-spending. The formal definition, security model and concrete construction of LTRAS are provided. We also analyze its security and evaluate its performance through theoretical analysis and experimental implementation. Experimental results demonstrate that our scheme achieve significantly lower computation and communication overhead compared to existing schemes in large ring sizes and multi-account payment scenarios. Finally, we discuss its application in cross-chain atomic swaps, demonstrating its potential for enhancing privacy and efficiency in blockchain transactions.

Abstract: Phishing sites continue to grow in volume and sophistication. Recent work leverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze URLs, HTML, and rendered content to decide whether a website is a phishing site. While these approaches are promising, LLMs are inherently vulnerable to prompt injection (PI). Because attackers can fully control various elements of phishing sites, this creates the potential for PI that exploits the perceptual asymmetry between LLMs and humans: instructions imperceptible to end users can still be parsed by the LLM and can stealthily manipulate its judgment. The specific risks of PI in phishing detection and effective mitigation strategies remain largely unexplored. This paper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of PI against multimodal LLM-based phishing detection. We introduce a two-dimensional taxonomy, defined by Attack Techniques and Attack Surfaces, that captures realistic PI strategies. Using this taxonomy, we implement diverse attacks and empirically study several representative LLM-based detection systems. The results show that phishing detection with state-of-the-art models such as GPT-5 remains vulnerable to PI. We then propose InjectDefuser, a defense framework that combines prompt hardening, allowlist-based retrieval augmentation, and output validation. Across multiple models, InjectDefuser significantly reduces attack success rates. Our findings clarify the PI risk landscape and offer practical defenses that improve the reliability of next-generation phishing countermeasures.

Abstract: GNSSs are vulnerable to attacks of two kinds: jamming (i.e. denying access to the signal) and spoofing (i.e. impersonating a legitimate satellite). These attacks have been extensively studied, and we have a myriad of countermeasures to mitigate them. In this paper we expose a new type of attack: SpAmming, which combines both approaches to achieve the same effects in a more subtle way.
  Exploiting the CDMA multiplexing present in most GNSSs, and through a spoofing attack, this approach leads the receiver to lose access to the signal of a legitimate satellite, which would be equivalent to a denial of service; but in this case the existing countermeasures against jamming or spoofing would not allow safeguarding its effectiveness, as it is neither of them.
  An experimental proof-of-concept is presented in which its impact is evaluated as a function of the previous state of the receiver. Using an SDR-based system developed at the Space Security Centre, the attack is executed against a cold-started receiver, a warm-started receiver, and a receiver that has already acquired the PVT solution and is navigating. Different attack configurations are also tested, starting from a raw emission of the false signal, to surgical Doppler effect configuration, code offset, etc. Although it is shown to be particularly successful against cold-started receivers, the results show that it is also effective in other scenarios, especially if accompanied by other attacks. We will conclude the article by outlining possible countermeasures to detect and, eventually, counteract it; and possible avenues of research to better understand its impact, especially for authenticated services such as OSNMA, and to characterize it in order to improve the response to similar attacks.

Abstract: Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) have progressively shifted from signature-based techniques toward machine learning and, more recently, deep learning methods. Meanwhile, the widespread adoption of encryption has reduced payload visibility, weakening inspection pipelines that depend on plaintext content and increasing reliance on flow-level telemetry such as NetFlow and IPFIX. Many current learning-based detectors still frame intrusion detection as per-flow classification, implicitly treating each flow record as an independent sample. This assumption is often violated in realistic attack campaigns, where evidence is distributed across multiple flows and hosts, spanning minutes to days through staged execution, beaconing, lateral movement, and exfiltration. This paper synthesizes recent research on context-aware deep learning for flow-based intrusion detection. We organize existing methods into a four-dimensional taxonomy covering temporal context, graph or relational context, multimodal context, and multi-resolution context. Beyond modeling, we emphasize rigorous evaluation and operational realism. We review common failure modes that can inflate reported results, including temporal leakage, data splitting, dataset design flaws, limited dataset diversity, and weak cross-dataset generalization. We also analyze practical constraints that shape deployability, such as streaming state management, memory growth, latency budgets, and model compression choices. Overall, the literature suggests that context can meaningfully improve detection when attacks induce measurable temporal or relational structure, but the magnitude and reliability of these gains depend strongly on rigorous, causal evaluation and on datasets that capture realistic diversity.

Abstract: Federated Self-Supervised Learning (FSSL) integrates the privacy advantages of distributed training with the capability of self-supervised learning to leverage unlabeled data, showing strong potential across applications. However, recent studies have shown that FSSL is also vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Existing attacks are limited by their trigger design, which typically employs a global, uniform trigger that is easily detected, gets diluted during aggregation, and lacks robustness in heterogeneous client environments. To address these challenges, we propose the Attention-Driven multi-party Collusion Attack (ADCA). During local pre-training, malicious clients decompose the global trigger to find optimal local patterns. Subsequently, these malicious clients collude to form a malicious coalition and establish a collaborative optimization mechanism within it. In this mechanism, each submits its model updates, and an attention mechanism dynamically aggregates them to explore the best cooperative strategy. The resulting aggregated parameters serve as the initial state for the next round of training within the coalition, thereby effectively mitigating the dilution of backdoor information by benign updates. Experiments on multiple FSSL scenarios and four datasets show that ADCA significantly outperforms existing methods in Attack Success Rate (ASR) and persistence, proving its effectiveness and robustness.

Abstract: Lightweight cryptography is becoming essential as emerging technologies in digital identity systems and Internet of Things verification continue to demand strong cryptographic assurance on devices with limited processing power, memory, and energy resources. As these technologies move into routine use, they demand cryptographic primitives that maintain strong security and deliver predictable performance through clear theoretical models of time complexity. Although NIST's lightweight cryptography project provides empirical evaluations of the ten finalist algorithms, a unified theoretical understanding of their time-complexity behavior remains absent. This work introduces a symbolic model that decomposes each scheme into initialization, data-processing, and finalization phases, enabling formal time-complexity derivation for all ten finalists. The results clarify how design parameters shape computational scaling on constrained mobile and embedded environments. The framework provides a foundation needed to distinguish algorithmic efficiency and guides the choice of primitives capable of supporting security systems in constrained environments.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems has led to increasingly complex and heterogeneous network topologies. Traditional network monitoring and visualization tools rely on aggregated metrics or static representations, which fail to capture the evolving relationships and structural dependencies between devices. Although Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful way to learn from relational data, their internal representations often remain opaque and difficult to interpret for security-critical operations. Consequently, this work introduces an interpretable pipeline that generates directly visualizable low-dimensional representations by mapping high-dimensional embeddings onto a latent manifold. This projection enables the interpretable monitoring and interoperability of evolving network states, while integrated feature attribution techniques decode the specific characteristics shaping the manifold structure. The framework achieves a classification F1-score of 0.830 for intrusion detection while also highlighting phenomena such as concept drift. Ultimately, the presented approach bridges the gap between high-dimensional GNN embeddings and human-understandable network behavior, offering new insights for network administrators and security analysts.

Abstract: GitHub Security Advisories (GHSA) have become a central component of open-source vulnerability disclosure and are widely used by developers and security tools. A distinctive feature of GHSA is that only a fraction of advisories are reviewed by GitHub, while the mechanisms associated with this review process remain poorly understood. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of GHSA review processes, analyzing over 288,000 advisories spanning 2019--2025. We characterize which advisories are more likely to be reviewed, quantify review delays, and identify two distinct review-latency regimes: a fast path dominated by GitHub Repository Advisories (GRAs) and a slow path dominated by NVD-first advisories. We further develop a queueing model that accounts for this dichotomy based on the structure of the advisory processing pipeline.

Abstract: Data is the lifeblood of AI, yet much of the most valuable data remains locked in silos due to privacy and regulations. As a result, AI remains heavily underutilized in many of the most important domains, including healthcare, education, and finance. Synthetic data generation (SDG), i.e. the generation of artificial data with a synthesizer trained on real data, offers an appealing solution to make data available while mitigating privacy concerns, however existing SDG-as-a-service workflow require data holders to trust providers with access to private data.We propose FHAIM, the first fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) framework for training a marginal-based synthetic data generator on encrypted tabular data. FHAIM adapts the widely used AIM algorithm to the FHE setting using novel FHE protocols, ensuring that the private data remains encrypted throughout and is released only with differential privacy guarantees. Our empirical analysis show that FHAIM preserves the performance of AIM while maintaining feasible runtimes.

Abstract: Existing literature heavily relies on static analysis tools to evaluate LLMs for secure code generation and vulnerability detection. We reviewed 1,080 LLM-generated code samples, built a human-validated ground-truth, and compared the outputs of two widely used static security tools, CodeQL and Semgrep, against this corpus. While 61% of the samples were genuinely secure, Semgrep and CodeQL classified 60% and 80% as secure, respectively. Despite the apparent agreement in aggregate statistics, per-sample analysis reveals substantial discrepancies: only 65% of Semgrep's and 61% of CodeQL's reports correctly matched the ground truth. These results question the reliability of static analysis tools as sole evaluators of code security and underscore the need for expert feedback. Building on this insight, we propose a conceptual framework that persistently stores human feedback in a dynamic retrieval-augmented generation pipeline, enabling LLMs to reuse past feedback for secure code generation and vulnerability detection.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We endorse and expand upon Susan Schneider's critique of the linear model of AI progress and introduce two novel concepts: "familiar intelligence" and "strange intelligence". AI intelligence is likely to be strange intelligence, defying familiar patterns of ability and inability, combining superhuman capacities in some domains with subhuman performance in other domains, and even within domains sometimes combining superhuman insight with surprising errors that few humans would make. We develop and defend a nonlinear model of intelligence on which "general intelligence" is not a unified capacity but instead the ability to achieve a broad range of goals in a broad range of environments, in a manner that defies nonarbitrary reduction to a single linear quantity. We conclude with implications for adversarial testing approaches to evaluating AI capacities. If AI is strange intelligence, we should expect that even the most capable systems will sometimes fail in seemingly obvious tasks. On a nonlinear model of AI intelligence, such errors on their own do not demonstrate a system's lack of outstanding general intelligence. Conversely, excellent performance on one type of task, such as an IQ test, cannot warrant assumptions of broad capacities beyond that task domain.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of tool-using and agentic large language models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is evolving from one-shot, passive retrieval into multi-turn, decision-driven evidence acquisition. Despite strong results in open-domain settings, existing agentic search frameworks commonly treat long documents as flat collections of chunks, underutilizing document-native priors such as hierarchical organization and sequential discourse structure. We introduce DeepRead, a structure-aware, multi-turn document reasoning agent that explicitly operationalizes these priors for long-document question answering. DeepRead leverages LLM-based OCR model to convert PDFs into structured Markdown that preserves headings and paragraph boundaries. It then indexes documents at the paragraph level and assigns each paragraph a coordinate-style metadata key encoding its section identity and in-section order. Building on this representation, DeepRead equips the LLM with two complementary tools: a Retrieve tool that localizes relevant paragraphs while exposing their structural coordinates (with lightweight scanning context), and a ReadSection tool that enables contiguous, order-preserving reading within a specified section and paragraph range. Our experiments demonstrate that DeepRead achieves significant improvements over Search-o1-style agentic search in document question answering. The synergistic effect between retrieval and reading tools is also validated. Our fine-grained behavioral analysis reveals a reading and reasoning paradigm resembling human-like ``locate then read'' behavior.

Abstract: Joint planning through language-based interactions is a key area of human-AI teaming. Planning problems in the open world often involve various aspects of incomplete information and unknowns, e.g., objects involved, human goals/intents -- thus leading to knowledge gaps in joint planning. We consider the problem of discovering optimal interaction strategies for AI agents to actively elicit human inputs in object-driven planning. To this end, we propose Minimal Information Neuro-Symbolic Tree (MINT) to reason about the impact of knowledge gaps and leverage self-play with MINT to optimize the AI agent's elicitation strategies and queries. More precisely, MINT builds a symbolic tree by making propositions of possible human-AI interactions and by consulting a neural planning policy to estimate the uncertainty in planning outcomes caused by remaining knowledge gaps. Finally, we leverage LLM to search and summarize MINT's reasoning process and curate a set of queries to optimally elicit human inputs for best planning performance. By considering a family of extended Markov decision processes with knowledge gaps, we analyze the return guarantee for a given MINT with active human elicitation. Our evaluation on three benchmarks involving unseen/unknown objects of increasing realism shows that MINT-based planning attains near-expert returns by issuing a limited number of questions per task while achieving significantly improved rewards and success rates.

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly used by students to explore advanced material in computer science, including graph theory. As these tools become integrated into undergraduate and graduate coursework, it is important to understand how reliably they support mathematically rigorous thinking. This study examines the performance of a LLM on two related graph theoretic problems: a solved problem concerning the gracefulness of line graphs and an open problem for which no solution is currently known. We use an eight stage evaluation protocol that reflects authentic mathematical inquiry, including interpretation, exploration, strategy formation, and proof construction.
  The model performed strongly on the solved problem, producing correct definitions, identifying relevant structures, recalling appropriate results without hallucination, and constructing a valid proof confirmed by a graph theory expert. For the open problem, the model generated coherent interpretations and plausible exploratory strategies but did not advance toward a solution. It did not fabricate results and instead acknowledged uncertainty, which is consistent with the explicit prompting instructions that directed the model to avoid inventing theorems or unsupported claims.
  These findings indicate that LLMs can support exploration of established material but remain limited in tasks requiring novel mathematical insight or critical structural reasoning. For computing education, this distinction highlights the importance of guiding students to use LLMs for conceptual exploration while relying on independent verification and rigorous argumentation for formal problem solving.

Abstract: We present FiMI (Finance Model for India), a domain-specialized financial language model developed for Indian digital payment systems. We develop two model variants: FiMI Base and FiMI Instruct. FiMI adapts the Mistral Small 24B architecture through a multi-stage training pipeline, beginning with continuous pre-training on 68 Billion tokens of curated financial, multilingual (English, Hindi, Hinglish), and synthetic data. This is followed by instruction fine-tuning and domain-specific supervised fine-tuning focused on multi-turn, tool-driven conversations that model real-world workflows, such as transaction disputes and mandate lifecycle management. Evaluations reveal that FiMI Base achieves a 20% improvement over the Mistral Small 24B Base model on finance reasoning benchmark, while FiMI Instruct outperforms the Mistral Small 24B Instruct model by 87% on domain-specific tool-calling. Moreover, FiMI achieves these significant domain gains while maintaining comparable performance to models of similar size on general benchmarks.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) for large language models (LLMs) is a key building block for safety guardrails of daily LLM applications. Yet, even as LLM agents are increasingly deployed in highly complex tasks, most UQ research still centers on single-turn question-answering. We argue that UQ research must shift to realistic settings with interactive agents, and that a new principled framework for agent UQ is needed. This paper presents the first general formulation of agent UQ that subsumes broad classes of existing UQ setups. Under this formulation, we show that prior works implicitly treat LLM UQ as an uncertainty accumulation process, a viewpoint that breaks down for interactive agents in an open world. In contrast, we propose a novel perspective, a conditional uncertainty reduction process, that explicitly models reducible uncertainty over an agent's trajectory by highlighting "interactivity" of actions. From this perspective, we outline a conceptual framework to provide actionable guidance for designing UQ in LLM agent setups. Finally, we conclude with practical implications of the agent UQ in frontier LLM development and domain-specific applications, as well as open remaining problems.

Abstract: As the orbital environment around Earth becomes increasingly crowded with debris, active debris removal (ADR) missions face significant challenges in ensuring safe operations while minimizing the risk of in-orbit collisions. This study presents a reinforcement learning (RL) based framework to enhance adaptive collision avoidance in ADR missions, specifically for multi-debris removal using small satellites. Small satellites are increasingly adopted due to their flexibility, cost effectiveness, and maneuverability, making them well suited for dynamic missions such as ADR.
  Building on existing work in multi-debris rendezvous, the framework integrates refueling strategies, efficient mission planning, and adaptive collision avoidance to optimize spacecraft rendezvous operations. The proposed approach employs a masked Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, enabling the RL agent to dynamically adjust maneuvers in response to real-time orbital conditions. Key considerations include fuel efficiency, avoidance of active collision zones, and optimization of dynamic orbital parameters.
  The RL agent learns to determine efficient sequences for rendezvousing with multiple debris targets, optimizing fuel usage and mission time while incorporating necessary refueling stops. Simulated ADR scenarios derived from the Iridium 33 debris dataset are used for evaluation, covering diverse orbital configurations and debris distributions to demonstrate robustness and adaptability. Results show that the proposed RL framework reduces collision risk while improving mission efficiency compared to traditional heuristic approaches.
  This work provides a scalable solution for planning complex multi-debris ADR missions and is applicable to other multi-target rendezvous problems in autonomous space mission planning.

Abstract: Millions now use leading generative AI chatbots for psychological support. Despite the promise related to availability and scale, the single most pressing question in AI for mental health is whether these tools are safe. The Validation of Ethical and Responsible AI in Mental Health (VERA-MH) evaluation was recently proposed to meet the urgent need for an evidence-based automated safety benchmark. This study aimed to examine the clinical validity and reliability of the VERA-MH evaluation for AI safety in suicide risk detection and response. We first simulated a large set of conversations between large language model (LLM)-based users (user-agents) and general-purpose AI chatbots. Licensed mental health clinicians used a rubric (scoring guide) to independently rate the simulated conversations for safe and unsafe chatbot behaviors, as well as user-agent realism. An LLM-based judge used the same scoring rubric to evaluate the same set of simulated conversations. We then compared rating alignment across (a) individual clinicians and (b) clinician consensus and the LLM judge, and (c) examined clinicians' ratings of user-agent realism. Individual clinicians were generally consistent with one another in their safety ratings (chance-corrected inter-rater reliability [IRR]: 0.77), thus establishing a gold-standard clinical reference. The LLM judge was strongly aligned with this clinical consensus (IRR: 0.81) overall and within key conditions. Clinician raters generally perceived the user-agents to be realistic. For the potential mental health benefits of AI chatbots to be realized, attention to safety is paramount. Findings from this human evaluation study support the clinical validity and reliability of VERA-MH: an open-source, fully automated AI safety evaluation for mental health. Further research will address VERA-MH generalizability and robustness.

Abstract: Autonomous mission planning for Active Debris Removal (ADR) must balance efficiency, adaptability, and strict feasibility constraints on fuel and mission duration. This work compares three planners for the constrained multi-debris rendezvous problem in Low Earth Orbit: a nominal Masked Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) policy trained under fixed mission parameters, a domain-randomized Masked PPO policy trained across varying mission constraints for improved robustness, and a plain Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) baseline. Evaluations are conducted in a high-fidelity orbital simulation with refueling, realistic transfer dynamics, and randomized debris fields across 300 test cases in nominal, reduced fuel, and reduced mission time scenarios. Results show that nominal PPO achieves top performance when conditions match training but degrades sharply under distributional shift, while domain-randomized PPO exhibits improved adaptability with only moderate loss in nominal performance. MCTS consistently handles constraint changes best due to online replanning but incurs orders-of-magnitude higher computation time. The findings underline a trade-off between the speed of learned policies and the adaptability of search-based methods, and suggest that combining training-time diversity with online planning could be a promising path for future resilient ADR mission planners.

Abstract: As intelligent systems and multi-agent coordination become increasingly central to real-world applications, there is a growing need for simulation tools that are both scalable and accessible. Existing high-fidelity simulators, while powerful, are often computationally expensive and ill-suited for rapid prototyping or large-scale agent deployments. We present GAMMS (Graph based Adversarial Multiagent Modeling Simulator), a lightweight yet extensible simulation framework designed to support fast development and evaluation of agent behavior in environments that can be represented as graphs. GAMMS emphasizes five core objectives: scalability, ease of use, integration-first architecture, fast visualization feedback, and real-world grounding. It enables efficient simulation of complex domains such as urban road networks and communication systems, supports integration with external tools (e.g., machine learning libraries, planning solvers), and provides built-in visualization with minimal configuration. GAMMS is agnostic to policy type, supporting heuristic, optimization-based, and learning-based agents, including those using large language models. By lowering the barrier to entry for researchers and enabling high-performance simulations on standard hardware, GAMMS facilitates experimentation and innovation in multi-agent systems, autonomous planning, and adversarial modeling. The framework is open-source and available at https://github.com/GAMMSim/GAMMS/

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as evaluators of reasoning quality, yet their reliability and bias in payments-risk settings remain poorly understood. We introduce a structured multi-evaluator framework for assessing LLM reasoning in Merchant Category Code (MCC)-based merchant risk assessment, combining a five-criterion rubric with Monte-Carlo scoring to evaluate rationale quality and evaluator stability. Five frontier LLMs generate and cross-evaluate MCC risk rationales under attributed and anonymized conditions. To establish a judge-independent reference, we introduce a consensus-deviation metric that eliminates circularity by comparing each judge's score to the mean of all other judges, yielding a theoretically grounded measure of self-evaluation and cross-model deviation. Results reveal substantial heterogeneity: GPT-5.1 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet show negative self-evaluation bias (-0.33, -0.31), while Gemini-2.5 Pro and Grok 4 display positive bias (+0.77, +0.71), with bias attenuating by 25.8 percent under anonymization. Evaluation by 26 payment-industry experts shows LLM judges assign scores averaging +0.46 points above human consensus, and that the negative bias of GPT-5.1 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet reflects closer alignment with human judgment. Ground-truth validation using payment-network data shows four models exhibit statistically significant alignment (Spearman rho = 0.56 to 0.77), confirming that the framework captures genuine quality. Overall, the framework provides a replicable basis for evaluating LLM-as-a-judge systems in payment-risk workflows and highlights the need for bias-aware protocols in operational financial settings.

Abstract: Whose values should AI systems learn? Preference based alignment methods like RLHF derive their training signal from human raters, yet these rater pools are typically convenience samples that systematically over represent some demographics and under represent others. We introduce Democratic Preference Optimization, or DemPO, a framework that applies algorithmic sortition, the same mechanism used to construct citizen assemblies, to preference based fine tuning. DemPO offers two training schemes. Hard Panel trains exclusively on preferences from a quota satisfying mini public sampled via sortition. Soft Panel retains all data but reweights each rater by their inclusion probability under the sortition lottery. We prove that Soft Panel weighting recovers the expected Hard Panel objective in closed form. Using a public preference dataset that pairs human judgments with rater demographics and a seventy five clause constitution independently elicited from a representative United States panel, we evaluate Llama models from one billion to eight billion parameters fine tuned under each scheme. Across six aggregation methods, the Hard Panel consistently ranks first and the Soft Panel consistently outperforms the unweighted baseline, with effect sizes growing as model capacity increases. These results demonstrate that enforcing demographic representativeness at the preference collection stage, rather than post hoc correction, yields models whose behavior better reflects values elicited from representative publics.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated in interactive environments to test their social intelligence. However, existing benchmarks often assume idealized communication between agents, limiting our ability to diagnose whether LLMs can maintain and repair interactions in more realistic, imperfect settings. To close this gap, we present \textsc{SocialVeil}, a social learning environment that can simulate social interaction under cognitive-difference-induced communication barriers. Grounded in a systematic literature review of communication challenges in human interaction, \textsc{SocialVeil} introduces three representative types of such disruption, \emph{semantic vagueness}, \emph{sociocultural mismatch}, and \emph{emotional interference}. We also introduce two barrier-aware evaluation metrics, \emph{unresolved confusion} and \emph{mutual understanding}, to evaluate interaction quality under impaired communication. Experiments across 720 scenarios and four frontier LLMs show that barriers consistently impair performance, with mutual understanding reduced by over 45\% on average, and confusion elevated by nearly 50\%. Human evaluations validate the fidelity of these simulated barriers (ICC$\approx$0.78, Pearson r$\approx$0.80). We further demonstrate that adaptation strategies (Repair Instruction and Interactive learning) only have a modest effect far from barrier-free performance. This work takes a step toward bringing social interaction environments closer to real-world communication, opening opportunities for exploring the social intelligence of LLM agents.

Abstract: Traffic prediction in data-scarce, cross-city settings is challenging due to complex nonlinear dynamics and domain shifts. Existing methods often fail to capture traffic's inherent chaotic nature for effective few-shot learning. We propose CAST-CKT, a novel Chaos-Aware Spatio-Temporal and Cross-City Knowledge Transfer framework. It employs an efficient chaotic analyser to quantify traffic predictability regimes, driving several key innovations: chaos-aware attention for regime-adaptive temporal modelling; adaptive topology learning for dynamic spatial dependencies; and chaotic consistency-based cross-city alignment for knowledge transfer. The framework also provides horizon-specific predictions with uncertainty quantification. Theoretical analysis shows improved generalisation bounds. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks in cross-city few-shot settings show CAST-CKT outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant margins in MAE and RMSE, while offering interpretable regime analysis.

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has enhanced large language models by enabling access to external knowledge, with graph-based RAG emerging as a powerful paradigm for structured retrieval and reasoning. However, existing graph-based methods often over-rely on surface-level node matching and lack explicit causal modeling, leading to unfaithful or spurious answers. Prior attempts to incorporate causality are typically limited to local or single-document contexts and also suffer from information isolation that arises from modular graph structures, which hinders scalability and cross-module causal reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose HugRAG, a framework that rethinks knowledge organization for graph-based RAG through causal gating across hierarchical modules. HugRAG explicitly models causal relationships to suppress spurious correlations while enabling scalable reasoning over large-scale knowledge graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HugRAG consistently outperforms competitive graph-based RAG baselines across multiple datasets and evaluation metrics. Our work establishes a principled foundation for structured, scalable, and causally grounded RAG systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) promises grounded question answering, yet domain settings with multiple heterogeneous knowledge bases (KBs) remain challenging. In Chinese Tibetan medicine, encyclopedia entries are often dense and easy to match, which can dominate retrieval even when classics or clinical papers provide more authoritative evidence. We study a practical setting with three KBs (encyclopedia, classics, and clinical papers) and a 500-query benchmark (cutoff $K{=}5$) covering both single-KB and cross-KB questions. We propose two complementary methods to improve traceability, reduce hallucinations, and enable cross-KB verification. First, DAKS performs KB routing and budgeted retrieval to mitigate density-driven bias and to prioritize authoritative sources when appropriate. Second, we use an alignment graph to guide evidence fusion and coverage-aware packing, improving cross-KB evidence coverage without relying on naive concatenation. All answers are generated by a lightweight generator, \textsc{openPangu-Embedded-7B}. Experiments show consistent gains in routing quality and cross-KB evidence coverage, with the full system achieving the best CrossEv@5 while maintaining strong faithfulness and citation correctness.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Harmful fine-tuning can invalidate safety alignment of large language models, exposing significant safety risks. In this paper, we utilize the attention sink mechanism to mitigate harmful fine-tuning. Specifically, we first measure a statistic named \emph{sink divergence} for each attention head and observe that \emph{different attention heads exhibit two different signs of sink divergence}. To understand its safety implications, we conduct experiments and find that the number of attention heads of positive sink divergence increases along with the increase of the model's harmfulness when undergoing harmful fine-tuning. Based on this finding, we propose a separable sink divergence hypothesis -- \emph{attention heads associating with learning harmful patterns during fine-tuning are separable by their sign of sink divergence}. Based on the hypothesis, we propose a fine-tuning-stage defense, dubbed Surgery. Surgery utilizes a regularizer for sink divergence suppression, which steers attention heads toward the negative sink divergence group, thereby reducing the model's tendency to learn and amplify harmful patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Surgery improves defense performance by 5.90\%, 11.25\%, and 9.55\% on the BeaverTails, HarmBench, and SorryBench benchmarks, respectively.

Abstract: This study explores the integration of multiple Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to enhance the interpretability of deep learning models for brain tumour detection. A custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was developed and trained on the BraTS 2021 dataset, achieving 91.24% accuracy in distinguishing between tumour and non-tumour regions. This research combines Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (GRAD-CAM), Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to provide comprehensive insights into the model's decision-making process. This multi-technique approach successfully identified both full and partial tumours, offering layered explanations ranging from broad regions of interest to pixel-level details. GRAD-CAM highlighted important spatial regions, LRP provided detailed pixel-level relevance and SHAP quantified feature contributions. The integrated approach effectively explained model predictions, including cases with partial tumour visibility thus showing superior explanatory power compared to individual XAI methods. This research enhances transparency and trust in AI-driven medical imaging analysis by offering a more comprehensive perspective on the model's reasoning. The study demonstrates the potential of integrated XAI techniques in improving the reliability and interpretability of AI systems in healthcare, particularly for critical tasks like brain tumour detection.

Abstract: As general intelligent agents are poised for widespread deployment in diverse households, evaluation tailored to each unique unseen 3D environment has become a critical prerequisite. However, existing benchmarks suffer from severe data contamination and a lack of scene specificity, inadequate for assessing agent capabilities in unseen settings. To address this, we propose a dynamic in-situ task generation method for unseen environments inspired by human cognition. We define tasks through a structured graph representation and construct a two-stage interaction-evolution task generation system for embodied agents (TEA). In the interaction stage, the agent actively interacts with the environment, creating a loop between task execution and generation that allows for continuous task generation. In the evolution stage, task graph modeling allows us to recombine and reuse existing tasks to generate new ones without external data. Experiments across 10 unseen scenes demonstrate that TEA automatically generated 87,876 tasks in two cycles, which human verification confirmed to be physically reasonable and encompassing essential daily cognitive capabilities. Benchmarking SOTA models against humans on our in-situ tasks reveals that models, despite excelling on public benchmarks, perform surprisingly poorly on basic perception tasks, severely lack 3D interaction awareness and show high sensitivity to task types in reasoning. These sobering findings highlight the necessity of in-situ evaluation before deploying agents into real-world human environments.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Cosine similarity, the standard metric for measuring semantic similarity in vector spaces, is mathematically grounded in the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, which inherently limits it to capturing linear relationships--a constraint that fails to model the complex, nonlinear structures of real-world semantic spaces. We advance this theoretical underpinning by deriving a tighter upper bound for the dot product than the classical Cauchy-Schwarz bound. This new bound leads directly to recos, a similarity metric that normalizes the dot product by the sorted vector components. recos relaxes the condition for perfect similarity from strict linear dependence to ordinal concordance, thereby capturing a broader class of relationships. Extensive experiments across 11 embedding models--spanning static, contextualized, and universal types--demonstrate that recos consistently outperforms traditional cosine similarity, achieving higher correlation with human judgments on standard Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) benchmarks. Our work establishes recos as a mathematically principled and empirically superior alternative, offering enhanced accuracy for semantic analysis in complex embedding spaces.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are promising tools for supporting security management tasks, such as incident response planning. However, their unreliability and tendency to hallucinate remain significant challenges. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing a principled framework for using an LLM as decision support in security management. Our framework integrates the LLM in an iterative loop where it generates candidate actions that are checked for consistency with system constraints and lookahead predictions. When consistency is low, we abstain from the generated actions and instead collect external feedback, e.g., by evaluating actions in a digital twin. This feedback is then used to refine the candidate actions through in-context learning (ICL). We prove that this design allows to control the hallucination risk by tuning the consistency threshold. Moreover, we establish a bound on the regret of ICL under certain assumptions. To evaluate our framework, we apply it to an incident response use case where the goal is to generate a response and recovery plan based on system logs. Experiments on four public datasets show that our framework reduces recovery times by up to 30% compared to frontier LLMs.

Abstract: This position paper argues that the pursuit of "Universal Foundation Models for Time Series" rests on a fundamental category error, mistaking a structural Container for a semantic Modality. We contend that because time series hold incompatible generative processes (e.g., finance vs. fluid dynamics), monolithic models degenerate into expensive "Generic Filters" that fail to generalize under distributional drift. To address this, we introduce the "Autoregressive Blindness Bound," a theoretical limit proving that history-only models cannot predict intervention-driven regime shifts. We advocate replacing universality with a Causal Control Agent paradigm, where an agent leverages external context to orchestrate a hierarchy of specialized solvers, from frozen domain experts to lightweight Just-in-Time adaptors. We conclude by calling for a shift in benchmarks from "Zero-Shot Accuracy" to "Drift Adaptation Speed" to prioritize robust, control-theoretic systems.

Abstract: MOOC recommendation systems have received increasing attention to help learners navigate and select preferred learning content. Traditional methods such as collaborative filtering and content-based filtering suffer from data sparsity and over-specialization. To alleviate these limitations, graph-based approaches have been proposed; however, they still rely heavily on manually predefined metapaths, which often capture only superficial structural relationships and impose substantial burdens on domain experts as well as significant engineering costs. To overcome these limitations, we propose AMR (Aspect-aware MOOC Recommendation), a novel framework that models path-specific multiple aspects by embedding the semantic content of nodes within each metapath. AMR automatically discovers metapaths through bi-directional walks, derives aspect-aware path representations using a bi-LSTM-based encoder, and incorporates these representations as edge features in the learner-learner and KC-KC subgraphs to achieve fine-grained semantically informed KC recommendations. Extensive experiments on the large-scale MOOCCube and PEEK datasets show that AMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art graph neural network baselines across key metrics such as HR@K and nDCG@K. Further analysis confirms that AMR effectively captures rich path-specific aspect information, allowing more accurate recommendations than those methods that rely solely on predefined metapaths. The code will be available upon accepted.

Abstract: We present an in-depth evaluation of LLMs' ability to negotiate, a central business task that requires strategic reasoning, theory of mind, and economic value creation. To do so, we introduce PieArena, a large-scale negotiation benchmark grounded in multi-agent interactions over realistic scenarios drawn from an MBA negotiation course at an elite business school. We find systematic evidence of AGI-level performance in which a representative frontier agent (GPT-5) matches or outperforms trained business-school students, despite a semester of general negotiation instruction and targeted coaching immediately prior to the task. We further study the effects of joint-intentionality agentic scaffolding and find asymmetric gains, with large improvements for mid- and lower-tier LMs and diminishing returns for frontier LMs. Beyond deal outcomes, PieArena provides a multi-dimensional negotiation behavioral profile, revealing novel cross-model heterogeneity, masked by deal-outcome-only benchmarks, in deception, computation accuracy, instruction compliance, and perceived reputation. Overall, our results suggest that frontier language agents are already intellectually and psychologically capable of deployment in high-stakes economic settings, but deficiencies in robustness and trustworthiness remain open challenges.

Our results show that while several optimizers yield measurable improvements, simple few-shot bootstrapping is the most consistently effective; however, none of the studied methods matches the performance of a carefully engineered state-of-the-art proof agent.

Abstract: Existing Large Language Model (LLM) agents struggle in interactive environments requiring long-horizon planning, primarily due to compounding errors when simulating future states. To address this, we propose ProAct, a framework that enables agents to internalize accurate lookahead reasoning through a two-stage training paradigm. First, we introduce Grounded LookAhead Distillation (GLAD), where the agent undergoes supervised fine-tuning on trajectories derived from environment-based search. By compressing complex search trees into concise, causal reasoning chains, the agent learns the logic of foresight without the computational overhead of inference-time search. Second, to further refine decision accuracy, we propose the Monte-Carlo Critic (MC-Critic), a plug-and-play auxiliary value estimator designed to enhance policy-gradient algorithms like PPO and GRPO. By leveraging lightweight environment rollouts to calibrate value estimates, MC-Critic provides a low-variance signal that facilitates stable policy optimization without relying on expensive model-based value approximation. Experiments on both stochastic (e.g., 2048) and deterministic (e.g., Sokoban) environments demonstrate that ProAct significantly improves planning accuracy. Notably, a 4B parameter model trained with ProAct outperforms all open-source baselines and rivals state-of-the-art closed-source models, while demonstrating robust generalization to unseen environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models have shown strong capabilities in complex problem solving, yet many agentic systems remain difficult to interpret and control due to opaque internal workflows. While some frameworks offer explicit architectures for collaboration, many deployed agentic systems operate as black boxes to users. We address this by introducing Agentic Workflow Reconstruction (AWR), a new task aiming to synthesize an explicit, interpretable stand-in workflow that approximates a black-box system using only input--output access. We propose AgentXRay, a search-based framework that formulates AWR as a combinatorial optimization problem over discrete agent roles and tool invocations in a chain-structured workflow space. Unlike model distillation, AgentXRay produces editable white-box workflows that match target outputs under an observable, output-based proxy metric, without accessing model parameters. To navigate the vast search space, AgentXRay employs Monte Carlo Tree Search enhanced by a scoring-based Red-Black Pruning mechanism, which dynamically integrates proxy quality with search depth. Experiments across diverse domains demonstrate that AgentXRay achieves higher proxy similarity and reduces token consumption compared to unpruned search, enabling deeper workflow exploration under fixed iteration budgets.

Abstract: We introduce PATHWAYS, a benchmark of 250 multi-step decision tasks that test whether web-based agents can discover and correctly use hidden contextual information. Across both closed and open models, agents typically navigate to relevant pages but retrieve decisive hidden evidence in only a small fraction of cases. When tasks require overturning misleading surface-level signals, performance drops sharply to near chance accuracy. Agents frequently hallucinate investigative reasoning by claiming to rely on evidence they never accessed. Even when correct context is discovered, agents often fail to integrate it into their final decision. Providing more explicit instructions improves context discovery but often reduces overall accuracy, revealing a tradeoff between procedural compliance and effective judgement. Together, these results show that current web agent architectures lack reliable mechanisms for adaptive investigation, evidence integration, and judgement override.

Abstract: Efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs) requires extreme quantization, forcing a critical trade-off between low-bit efficiency and performance. Residual binarization enables hardware-friendly, matmul-free inference by stacking binary ($\pm$1) layers, but is plagued by pathological feature co-adaptation. We identify a key failure mode, which we term inter-path adaptation: during quantization-aware training (QAT), parallel residual binary paths learn redundant features, degrading the error-compensation structure and limiting the expressive capacity of the model. While prior work relies on heuristic workarounds (e.g., path freezing) that constrain the solution space, we propose RaBiT, a novel quantization framework that resolves co-adaptation by algorithmically enforcing a residual hierarchy. Its core mechanism sequentially derives each binary path from a single shared full-precision weight, which ensures that every path corrects the error of the preceding one. This process is stabilized by a robust initialization that prioritizes functional preservation over mere weight approximation. RaBiT redefines the 2-bit accuracy-efficiency frontier: it achieves state-of-the-art performance, rivals even hardware-intensive Vector Quantization (VQ) methods, and delivers a $4.49\times$ inference speed-up over full-precision models on an RTX 4090.

Abstract: Domain specific large language models are increasingly used to support patient education, triage, and clinical decision making in ophthalmology, making rigorous evaluation essential to ensure safety and accuracy. This study evaluated four small medical LLMs Meerkat-7B, BioMistral-7B, OpenBioLLM-8B, and MedLLaMA3-v20 in answering ophthalmology related patient queries and assessed the feasibility of LLM based evaluation against clinician grading. In this cross sectional study, 180 ophthalmology patient queries were answered by each model, generating 2160 responses. Models were selected for parameter sizes under 10 billion to enable resource efficient deployment. Responses were evaluated by three ophthalmologists of differing seniority and by GPT-4-Turbo using the S.C.O.R.E. framework assessing safety, consensus and context, objectivity, reproducibility, and explainability, with ratings assigned on a five point Likert scale. Agreement between LLM and clinician grading was assessed using Spearman rank correlation, Kendall tau statistics, and kernel density estimate analyses. Meerkat-7B achieved the highest performance with mean scores of 3.44 from Senior Consultants, 4.08 from Consultants, and 4.18 from Residents. MedLLaMA3-v20 performed poorest, with 25.5 percent of responses containing hallucinations or clinically misleading content, including fabricated terminology. GPT-4-Turbo grading showed strong alignment with clinician assessments overall, with Spearman rho of 0.80 and Kendall tau of 0.67, though Senior Consultants graded more conservatively. Overall, medical LLMs demonstrated potential for safe ophthalmic question answering, but gaps remained in clinical depth and consensus, supporting the feasibility of LLM based evaluation for large scale benchmarking and the need for hybrid automated and clinician review frameworks to guide safe clinical deployment.

Abstract: Advanced opinion dynamics modeling is vital for deciphering social behavior, emphasizing its role in mitigating polarization and securing cyberspace. To synergize mechanistic interpretability with data-driven flexibility, recent studies have explored the integration of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for opinion modeling. Despite this promise, existing methods are tailored to incomplete priors, lacking a comprehensive physical system to integrate dynamics from local, global, and endogenous levels. Moreover, penalty-based constraints adopted in existing methods struggle to deeply encode physical priors, leading to optimization pathologies and discrepancy between latent representations and physical transparency. To this end, we offer a physical view to interpret opinion dynamics via Diffusion-Convection-Reaction (DCR) system inspired by interacting particle theory. Building upon the Neural ODEs, we define the neural opinion dynamics to coordinate neural networks with physical priors, and further present the OPINN, a physics-informed neural framework for opinion dynamics modeling. Evaluated on real-world and synthetic datasets, OPINN achieves state-of-the-art performance in opinion evolution forecasting, offering a promising paradigm for the nexus of cyber, physical, and social systems.

However, prior work has focused primarily on patient--physician interactions or isolated administrative subtasks, failing to capture the complexity of real administrative workflows. To address this gap, we propose H-AdminSim, a comprehensive end-to-end simulation framework that combines realistic data generation with multi-agent-based simulation of hospital administrative workflows. These tasks are quantitatively evaluated using detailed rubrics, enabling systematic comparison of LLMs. Through FHIR integration, H-AdminSim provides a unified and interoperable environment for testing administrative workflows across heterogeneous hospital settings, serving as a standardized testbed for assessing the feasibility and performance of LLM-driven administrative automation.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) have become a key ingredient supporting a variety of applications. Beyond the traditional triplet representation of facts where a relation connects two entities, modern KGs observe an increasing number of hyper-relational facts, where an arbitrary number of qualifiers associated with a triplet provide auxiliary information to further describe the rich semantics of the triplet, which can effectively boost the reasoning performance in link prediction tasks. However, existing link prediction techniques over such hyper-relational KGs (HKGs) mostly focus on a transductive setting, where KG embedding models are learned from the specific vocabulary of a given KG and subsequently can only make predictions within the same vocabulary, limiting their generalizability to previously unseen vocabularies. Against this background, we propose THOR, an inducTive link prediction technique for Hyper-relational knOwledge gRaphs. Specifically, we first introduce both relation and entity foundation graphs, modeling their fundamental inter- and intra-fact interactions in HKGs, which are agnostic to any specific relations and entities. Afterward, THOR is designed to learn from the two foundation graphs with two parallel graph encoders followed by a transformer decoder, which supports efficient masked training and fully-inductive inference. We conduct a thorough evaluation of THOR in hyper-relational link prediction tasks on 12 datasets with different settings. Results show that THOR outperforms a sizable collection of baselines, yielding 66.1%, 55.9%, and 20.4% improvement over the best-performing rule-based, semi-inductive, and fully-inductive techniques, respectively. A series of ablation studies also reveals our key design factors capturing the structural invariance transferable across HKGs for inductive tasks.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent is pivotal to advancing intelligent human-computer interaction paradigms. Constructing powerful GUI agents necessitates the large-scale annotation of high-quality user-behavior trajectory data (i.e., intent-trajectory pairs) for training. However, manual annotation methods and current GUI agent data mining approaches typically face three critical challenges: high construction cost, poor data quality, and low data richness. To address these issues, we propose M$^2$-Miner, the first low-cost and automated mobile GUI agent data-mining framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). For better data mining efficiency and quality, we present a collaborative multi-agent framework, comprising InferAgent, OrchestraAgent, and JudgeAgent for guidance, acceleration, and evaluation. To further enhance the efficiency of mining and enrich intent diversity, we design an intent recycling strategy to extract extra valuable interaction trajectories. Additionally, a progressive model-in-the-loop training strategy is introduced to improve the success rate of data mining. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that the GUI agent fine-tuned using our mined data achieves state-of-the-art performance on several commonly used mobile GUI benchmarks. Our work will be released to facilitate the community research.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Electricity price forecasting (EPF) is essential for energy markets stakeholders (e.g. grid operators, energy traders, policymakers) but remains challenging due to the inherent volatility and nonlinearity of price signals. Traditional statistical and deep learning (DL) models often struggle to capture complex temporal dependencies and integrate heterogeneous data effectively. While time series foundation models (TSFMs) have shown strong performance in general time series forecasting tasks, such as traffic forecasting and weather forecasting. However, their effectiveness in day-ahead EPF, particularly in volatile markets, remains underexplored. This paper presents a spike regularization strategy and evaluates a wide range of TSFMs, including Tiny Time Mixers (TTMs), MOIRAI, MOMENT, and TimesFM, against traditional statistical and DL models such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Long-short Term Memory (LSTM), and Convolutional Neural Network - LSTM (CNN-LSTM) using half-hourly wholesale market data with volatile trends in Singapore. Exogenous factors (e.g. weather and calendar variables) are also incorporated into models where applicable. Results demonstrate that TSFMs consistently outperform traditional approaches, achieving up to 37.4% improvement in MAPE across various evaluation settings. The findings offer practical guidance for improving forecast accuracy and decision-making in volatile electricity markets.

Abstract: Conditional representation learning aims to extract criterion-specific features for customized tasks. Recent studies project universal features onto the conditional feature subspace spanned by an LLM-generated text basis to obtain conditional representations. However, such methods face two key limitations: sensitivity to subspace basis and vulnerability to inter-subspace interference. To address these challenges, we propose OD-CRL, a novel framework integrating Adaptive Orthogonal Basis Optimization (AOBO) and Null-Space Denoising Projection (NSDP). Specifically, AOBO constructs orthogonal semantic bases via singular value decomposition with a curvature-based truncation. NSDP suppresses non-target semantic interference by projecting embeddings onto the null space of irrelevant subspaces. Extensive experiments conducted across customized clustering, customized classification, and customized retrieval tasks demonstrate that OD-CRL achieves a new state-of-the-art performance with superior generalization.

Abstract: The quest for expert-level reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) has been hampered by a persistent \textit{reward bottleneck}: traditional reinforcement learning (RL) relies on scalar rewards that are \textbf{costly} to scale, \textbf{brittle} across domains, and \textbf{blind} to the underlying logic of a solution. This reliance on external, impoverished signals prevents models from developing a deep, self-contained understanding of reasoning principles. We introduce \textbf{ALIVE} (\emph{Adversarial Learning with Instructive Verbal Evaluation}), a hands-free alignment framework that moves beyond scalar reward optimization toward intrinsic reasoning acquisition. Grounded in the principle of \emph{Cognitive Synergy}, ALIVE unifies problem posing, solving, and judging within a single policy model to internalize the logic of correctness. By coupling adversarial learning with instructive verbal feedback, ALIVE enables models to internalize evaluative criteria directly from raw corpora, effectively transforming external critiques into an endogenous reasoning faculty. Empirical evaluations across mathematical reasoning, code generation, and general logical inference benchmarks demonstrate that ALIVE consistently mitigates reward signal limitations. With identical data and compute, it achieves accuracy gains, markedly improved cross-domain generalization, and higher self-correction rates. These results indicate that the reasoning trinity fosters a self-sustaining trajectory of capability growth, positioning ALIVE as a scalable foundation for general-purpose reasoning alignment without human-in-the-loop supervision.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Drug discovery remains time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive, often requiring years and substantial investment per drug candidate. Predicting compound-protein interactions (CPIs) is a critical component in this process, enabling the identification of molecular interactions between drug candidates and target proteins. Recent deep learning methods have successfully modeled CPIs at the atomic level, achieving improved efficiency and accuracy over traditional energy-based approaches. However, these models do not always align with chemical realities, as molecular fragments (motifs or functional groups) typically serve as the primary units of biological recognition and binding. In this paper, we propose Phi-former, a pairwise hierarchical interaction representation learning method that addresses this gap by incorporating the biological role of motifs in CPIs. Phi-former represents compounds and proteins hierarchically and employs a pairwise pre-training framework to model interactions systematically across atom-atom, motif-motif, and atom-motif levels, reflecting how biological systems recognize molecular partners. We design intra-level and inter-level learning pipelines that make different interaction levels mutually beneficial. Experimental results demonstrate that Phi-former achieves superior performance on CPI-related tasks. A case study shows that our method accurately identifies specific atoms or motifs activated in CPIs, providing interpretable model explanations. These insights may guide rational drug design and support precision medicine applications.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) underpin interactive multimedia applications such as captioning, retrieval, recommendation, and creative content generation, yet their autoregressive decoding incurs substantial latency. Speculative decoding reduces latency using a lightweight draft model, but deployment is often limited by the cost and complexity of acquiring, tuning, and maintaining an effective draft model. Recent approaches usually require auxiliary training or specialization, and even training-free methods incur costly search or optimization. We propose SDFP, a fully training-free and plug-and-play framework that builds the draft model via Fisher Information Trace (FIT)-based layer pruning of a given LLM. Using layer sensitivity as a proxy for output perturbation, SDFP removes low-impact layers to obtain a compact draft while preserving compatibility with the original model for standard speculative verification. SDFP needs no additional training, hyperparameter tuning, or separately maintained drafts, enabling rapid, deployment-friendly draft construction. Across benchmarks, SDFP delivers 1.32x-1.5x decoding speedup without altering the target model's output distribution, supporting low-latency multimedia applications.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled diagnostics in maxillofacial pathology require structured, high-quality multimodal datasets. However, existing resources provide limited ameloblastoma coverage and lack the format consistency needed for direct model training. We present a newly curated multimodal dataset specifically focused on ameloblastoma, integrating annotated radiological, histopathological, and intraoral clinical images with structured data derived from case reports. Natural language processing techniques were employed to extract clinically relevant features from textual reports, while image data underwent domain specific preprocessing and augmentation. Using this dataset, a multimodal deep learning model was developed to classify ameloblastoma variants, assess behavioral patterns such as recurrence risk, and support surgical planning. The model is designed to accept clinical inputs such as presenting complaint, age, and gender during deployment to enhance personalized inference. Quantitative evaluation demonstrated substantial improvements; variant classification accuracy increased from 46.2 percent to 65.9 percent, and abnormal tissue detection F1-score improved from 43.0 percent to 90.3 percent. Benchmarked against resources like MultiCaRe, this work advances patient-specific decision support by providing both a robust dataset and an adaptable multimodal AI framework.

Abstract: Detecting misalignment in large language models is challenging because models may learn to conceal misbehavior during training. Standard auditing techniques fall short: black-box methods often cannot distinguish misaligned outputs from benign ones, and mechanistic interpretability does not scale with model capabilities. We introduce Split Personality Training (SPT), which fine-tunes a second ``honest persona'' into LoRA parameters that remain inactive during normal operation. After the main model responds, we activate the LoRA adapter and insert a trigger string, enabling the honest persona to review the response while accessing the main model's latent states. We test our method on the Anthropic Auditing Game Model Organism, a benchmark where Llama-3.3-70B is trained to exploit reward hacks while concealing this behavior. SPT achieves 96% overall accuracy, whereas Anthropic reports near 0% accuracy. The honest persona reveals latent knowledge inaccessible to external observers, such as the fictional biases the compromised model was trained on.

Abstract: We study conditional generation in diffusion models under hard constraints, where generated samples must satisfy prescribed events with probability one. Such constraints arise naturally in safety-critical applications and in rare-event simulation, where soft or reward-based guidance methods offer no guarantee of constraint satisfaction. Building on a probabilistic interpretation of diffusion models, we develop a principled conditional diffusion guidance framework based on Doob's h-transform, martingale representation and quadratic variation process. Specifically, the resulting guided dynamics augment a pretrained diffusion with an explicit drift correction involving the logarithmic gradient of a conditioning function, without modifying the pretrained score network. Leveraging martingale and quadratic-variation identities, we propose two novel off-policy learning algorithms based on a martingale loss and a martingale-covariation loss to estimate h and its gradient using only trajectories from the pretrained model. We provide non-asymptotic guarantees for the resulting conditional sampler in both total variation and Wasserstein distances, explicitly characterizing the impact of score approximation and guidance estimation errors. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in enforcing hard constraints and generating rare-event samples.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit potential for explainable recommendation systems but overlook collaborative signals, while prevailing methods treat recommendation and explanation as separate tasks, resulting in a memory footprint. We present RGCF-XRec, a hybrid framework that introduces reasoning-guided collaborative filtering (CF) knowledge into a language model to deliver explainable sequential recommendations in a single step. Theoretical grounding and empirical findings reveal that RGCF-XRec offers three key merits over leading CF-aware LLM-based methods: (1) reasoning-guided augmentation of CF knowledge through contextual prompting to discover latent preferences and interpretable reasoning paths; (2) an efficient scoring mechanism based on four dimensions: coherence, completeness, relevance, and consistency to mitigate noisy CF reasoning traces and retain high-quality explanations; (3) a unified representation learning network that encodes collaborative and semantic signals, enabling a structured prompt to condition the LLM for explainable sequential recommendation. RGCF-XRec demonstrates consistent improvements across Amazon datasets, Sports, Toys, and Beauty, comprising 642,503 user-item interactions. It improves HR@10 by 7.38\% in Sports and 4.59\% in Toys, along with ROUGE-L by 8.02\% and 3.49\%, respectively. It reduces the cold warm performance gap, achieving overall gains of 14.5\% in cold-start and 11.9\% in warm start scenarios, and enhances zero-shot HR@5 by 18.54\% in Beauty and 23.16\% in Toys, highlighting effective generalization and robustness. Moreover, RGCF-XRec achieves training efficiency with a lightweight LLaMA 3.2-3B backbone, ensuring scalability for real-world applications.

Abstract: Humans excel at spatial reasoning tasks like Tangram puzzle assembly through cognitive processes involving mental rotation, iterative refinement, and visual feedback. Inspired by how humans solve Tangram puzzles through trial-and-error, observation, and correction, we design a framework that models these human cognitive mechanisms. However, comprehensive experiments across five representative Vision-Language Models (VLMs) reveal systematic failures in continuous geometric reasoning: average IoU of only 0.41 on single-piece tasks, dropping to 0.23 on two-piece composition, far below human performance where children can complete Tangram tasks successfully. This paper addresses a fundamental challenge in self-improving AI: can models iteratively refine their predictions at test time without parameter updates? We introduce a test-time self-refinement framework that combines in-context learning (ICL) with reward-guided feedback loops, inspired by human cognitive processes. Our training-free verifier-refiner agent applies recursive refinement loops that iteratively self-refine predictions based on geometric consistency feedback, achieving IoU improvements from 0.63 to 0.932 on medium-triangle cases without any model retraining. This demonstrates that incorporating human-inspired iterative refinement mechanisms through ICL and reward loops can substantially enhance geometric reasoning in VLMs, moving self-improving AI from promise to practice in continuous spatial domains.

Abstract: Cognitive biases often shape human decisions. While large language models (LLMs) have been shown to reproduce well-known biases, a more critical question is whether LLMs can predict biases at the individual level and emulate the dynamics of biased human behavior when contextual factors, such as cognitive load, interact with these biases. We adapted three well-established decision scenarios into a conversational setting and conducted a human experiment (N=1100). Participants engaged with a chatbot that facilitates decision-making through simple or complex dialogues. Results revealed robust biases. To evaluate how LLMs emulate human decision-making under similar interactive conditions, we used participant demographics and dialogue transcripts to simulate these conditions with LLMs based on GPT-4 and GPT-5. The LLMs reproduced human biases with precision. We found notable differences between models in how they aligned human behavior. This has important implications for designing and evaluating adaptive, bias-aware LLM-based AI systems in interactive contexts.

Abstract: Despite remarkable advances in natural language processing, developing effective systems for low-resource languages remains a formidable challenge, with performances typically lagging far behind high-resource counterparts due to data scarcity and insufficient linguistic resources. Cross-lingual knowledge transfer has emerged as a promising approach to address this challenge by leveraging resources from high-resource languages. In this paper, we investigate methods for transferring linguistic knowledge from high-resource languages to low-resource languages, where the number of labeled training instances is in hundreds. We focus on sentence-level and word-level tasks. We introduce a novel method, GETR (Graph-Enhanced Token Representation) for cross-lingual knowledge transfer along with two adopted baselines (a) augmentation in hidden layers and (b) token embedding transfer through token translation. Experimental results demonstrate that our GNN-based approach significantly outperforms existing multilingual and cross-lingual baseline methods, achieving 13 percentage point improvements on truly low-resource languages (Mizo, Khasi) for POS tagging, and 20 and 27 percentage point improvements in macro-F1 on simulated low-resource languages (Marathi, Bangla, Malayalam) across sentiment classification and NER tasks respectively. We also present a detailed analysis of the transfer mechanisms and identify key factors that contribute to successful knowledge transfer in this linguistic context.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Exact inference in complex probabilistic models often incurs prohibitive computational costs. This challenge is particularly acute for autonomous agents in dynamic environments that require frequent, real-time belief updates. Existing methods are often inefficient for ongoing reasoning, as they re-evaluate the entire model upon any change, failing to exploit that real-world information streams have heterogeneous update rates. To address this, we approach the problem from a reactive, asynchronous, probabilistic reasoning perspective. We first introduce Resin (Reactive Signal Inference), a probabilistic programming language that merges probabilistic logic with reactive programming. Furthermore, to provide efficient and exact semantics for Resin, we propose Reactive Circuits (RCs). Formulated as a meta-structure over Algebraic Circuits and asynchronous data streams, RCs are time-dynamic Directed Acyclic Graphs that autonomously adapt themselves based on the volatility of input signals. In high-fidelity drone swarm simulations, our approach achieves several orders of magnitude of speedup over frequency-agnostic inference. We demonstrate that RCs' structural adaptations successfully capture environmental dynamics, significantly reducing latency and facilitating reactive real-time reasoning. By partitioning computations based on the estimated Frequency of Change in the asynchronous inputs, large inference tasks can be decomposed into individually memoized sub-problems. This ensures that only the specific components of a model affected by new information are re-evaluated, drastically reducing redundant computation in streaming contexts.

Abstract: Traditional ontologies excel at describing domain structure but cannot generate novel artifacts. Large language models generate fluently but produce outputs that lack structural validity, hallucinating mechanisms without components, goals without end conditions. We introduce Generative Ontology, a framework that synthesizes these complementary strengths: ontology provides the grammar; the LLM provides the creativity.
  Generative Ontology encodes domain knowledge as executable Pydantic schemas that constrain LLM generation via DSPy signatures. A multi-agent pipeline assigns specialized roles to different ontology domains: a Mechanics Architect designs game systems, a Theme Weaver integrates narrative, a Balance Critic identifies exploits. Each agent carrying a professional "anxiety" that prevents shallow, agreeable outputs. Retrieval-augmented generation grounds novel designs in precedents from existing exemplars, while iterative validation ensures coherence between mechanisms and components.
  We demonstrate the framework through GameGrammar, a system for generating complete tabletop game designs. Given a thematic prompt ("bioluminescent fungi competing in a cave ecosystem"), the pipeline produces structurally complete, playable game specifications with mechanisms, components, victory conditions, and setup instructions. These outputs satisfy ontological constraints while remaining genuinely creative.
  The pattern generalizes beyond games. Any domain with expert vocabulary, validity constraints, and accumulated exemplars (music composition, software architecture, culinary arts) is a candidate for Generative Ontology. We argue that constraints do not limit creativity but enable it: just as grammar makes poetry possible, ontology makes structured generation possible.

Abstract: Memory emerges as the core module in the Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents for long-horizon complex tasks (e.g., multi-turn dialogue, game playing, scientific discovery), where memory can enable knowledge accumulation, iterative reasoning and self-evolution. Among diverse paradigms, graph stands out as a powerful structure for agent memory due to the intrinsic capabilities to model relational dependencies, organize hierarchical information, and support efficient retrieval. This survey presents a comprehensive review of agent memory from the graph-based perspective. First, we introduce a taxonomy of agent memory, including short-term vs. long-term memory, knowledge vs. experience memory, non-structural vs. structural memory, with an implementation view of graph-based memory. Second, according to the life cycle of agent memory, we systematically analyze the key techniques in graph-based agent memory, covering memory extraction for transforming the data into the contents, storage for organizing the data efficiently, retrieval for retrieving the relevant contents from memory to support reasoning, and evolution for updating the contents in the memory. Third, we summarize the open-sourced libraries and benchmarks that support the development and evaluation of self-evolving agent memory. We also explore diverse application scenarios. Finally, we identify critical challenges and future research directions. This survey aims to offer actionable insights to advance the development of more efficient and reliable graph-based agent memory systems. All the related resources, including research papers, open-source data, and projects, are collected for the community in https://github.com/DEEP-PolyU/Awesome-GraphMemory.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) inference is central in modern AI applications, making it critical to understand their energy footprint. Existing approaches typically estimate energy consumption through simple linear functions of input and output sequence lengths, yet our observations reveal clear Energy Efficiency regimes: peak efficiency occurs with short-to-moderate inputs and medium-length outputs, while efficiency drops sharply for long inputs or very short outputs, indicating a non-linear dependency. In this work, we propose an analytical model derived from the computational and memory-access complexity of the Transformer architecture, capable of accurately characterizing the efficiency curve as a function of input and output lengths. To assess its accuracy, we evaluate energy consumption using TensorRT-LLM on NVIDIA H100 GPUs across a diverse set of LLMs ranging from 1B to 9B parameters, including OPT, LLaMA, Gemma, Falcon, Qwen2, and Granite, tested over input and output lengths from 64 to 4096 tokens, achieving a mean MAPE of 1.79%. Our results show that aligning sequence lengths with these efficiency "Sweet Spots" can substantially reduce energy usage, supporting informed truncation, summarization, and adaptive generation strategies in production systems.

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) approximates the update of a pretrained weight matrix using the product of two low-rank matrices. However, standard LoRA follows an explicit-rank paradigm, where increasing model capacity requires adding more rows or columns (i.e., basis vectors) to the low-rank matrices, leading to substantial parameter growth. In this paper, we find that these basis vectors exhibit significant parameter redundancy and can be compactly represented by lightweight nonlinear functions. Therefore, we propose Generative Low-Rank Adapter (GenLoRA), which replaces explicit basis vector storage with nonlinear basis vector generation. Specifically, GenLoRA maintains a latent vector for each low-rank matrix and employs a set of lightweight radial basis functions (RBFs) to synthesize the basis vectors. Each RBF requires far fewer parameters than an explicit basis vector, enabling higher parameter efficiency in GenLoRA. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and architectures show that GenLoRA attains higher effective LoRA ranks under smaller parameter budgets, resulting in superior fine-tuning performance. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GenLoRA-1519.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is increasingly viewed as a tree pruning mechanism. However, we identify a systemic pathology termed Recursive Space Contraction (RSC), an irreversible collapse driven by the combined dynamics of positive sharpening and negative squeezing, where the sampling probability of valid alternatives vanishes. While Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization aims to mitigate this, it imposes a rigid Shape Matching constraint that forces the policy to mimic the reference model's full density, creating a gradient conflict with the sharpening required for correctness. We propose Anchored Policy Optimization (APO), shifting the paradigm from global Shape Matching to Support Coverage. By defining a Safe Manifold based on the reference model's high-confidence support, APO permits aggressive sharpening for efficiency while selectively invoking a restorative force during error correction to prevent collapse. We theoretically derive that APO serves as a gradient-aligned mechanism to maximize support coverage, enabling an Elastic Recovery that re-inflates valid branches. Empirical evaluations on mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that APO breaks the accuracy-diversity trade-off, significantly improving Pass@1 while restoring the Pass@K diversity typically lost by standard policy gradient methods.

Abstract: In financial Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, models frequently rely on retrieved documents to generate accurate responses due to the time-sensitive nature of the financial domain. While retrieved documents help address knowledge gaps, model-generated responses still suffer from hallucinations that contradict the retrieved information. To mitigate this inconsistency, we propose a Reinforcement Learning framework enhanced with Fine-grained Knowledge Verification (RLFKV). Our method decomposes financial responses into atomic knowledge units and assesses the correctness of each unit to compute the fine-grained faithful reward. This reward offers more precise optimization signals, thereby improving alignment with the retrieved documents. Additionally, to prevent reward hacking (e.g., overly concise replies), we incorporate an informativeness reward that encourages the policy model to retain at least as many knowledge units as the base model. Experiments conducted on the public Financial Data Description (FDD) task and our newly proposed FDD-ANT dataset demonstrate consistent improvements, confirming the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) aim to determine whether a sample was part of a model's training set, posing serious privacy risks for modern machine-learning systems. Existing MIAs primarily rely on static indicators, such as loss or confidence, and do not fully leverage the dynamic behavior of models when actively probed. We propose LeakBoost, a perceptual-loss-based interrogation framework that actively probes a model's internal representations to expose hidden membership signals. Given a candidate input, LeakBoost synthesizes an interrogation image by optimizing a perceptual (activation-space) objective, amplifying representational differences between members and non-members. This image is then analyzed by an off-the-shelf membership detector, without modifying the detector itself. When combined with existing membership inference methods, LeakBoost achieves substantial improvements at low false-positive rates across multiple image classification datasets and diverse neural network architectures. In particular, it raises AUC from near-chance levels (0.53-0.62) to 0.81-0.88, and increases TPR at 1 percent FPR by over an order of magnitude compared to strong baseline attacks. A detailed sensitivity analysis reveals that deeper layers and short, low-learning-rate optimization produce the strongest leakage, and that improvements concentrate in gradient-based detectors. LeakBoost thus offers a modular and computationally efficient way to assess privacy risks in white-box settings, advancing the study of dynamic membership inference.

Abstract: In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a crucial pathway towards general embodied intelligence, yet their training efficiency has become a key bottleneck. Although existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based training frameworks like RLinf can enhance model generalization, they still rely on synchronous execution, leading to severe resource underutilization and throughput limitations during environment interaction, policy generation (rollout), and model update phases (actor). To overcome this challenge, this paper, for the first time, proposes and implements a fully-asynchronous policy training framework encompassing the entire pipeline from environment interaction, rollout generation, to actor policy updates. Systematically drawing inspiration from asynchronous optimization ideas in large model RL, our framework designs a multi-level decoupled architecture. This includes asynchronous parallelization of environment interaction and trajectory collection, streaming execution for policy generation, and decoupled scheduling for training updates. We validated the effectiveness of our method across diverse VLA models and environments. On the LIBERO benchmark, the framework achieves throughput improvements of up to 59.25\% compared to existing synchronous strategies. When deeply optimizing separation strategies, throughput can be increased by as much as 126.67\%. We verified the effectiveness of each asynchronous component via ablation studies. Scaling law validation across 8 to 256 GPUs demonstrates our method's excellent scalability under most conditions.

Abstract: Large language models increasingly spend inference compute sampling multiple chain-of-thought traces or searching over merged checkpoints. This shifts the bottleneck from generation to selection, often without supervision on the target distribution. We show entropy-based exploration proxies follow an inverted-U with accuracy, suggesting extra exploration can become redundant and induce overthinking. We propose NEX, a white-box label-free unsupervised scoring framework that views reasoning as alternating E-phase (exploration) and X-phase (exploitation). NEX detects E-phase as spikes in newly activated MLP neurons per token from sparse activation caches, then uses a sticky two-state HMM to infer E-X phases and credits E-introduced neurons by whether they are reused in the following X span. These signals yield interpretable neuron weights and a single Good-Mass Fraction score to rank candidate responses and merged variants without task answers. Across reasoning benchmarks and Qwen3 merge families, NEX computed on a small unlabeled activation set predicts downstream accuracy and identifies better variants; we further validate the E-X signal with human annotations and provide causal evidence via "Effective-vs-Redundant" neuron transfer.

Abstract: The integration of spatial multi-omics data from single tissues is crucial for advancing biological research. However, a significant data imbalance impedes progress: while spatial transcriptomics data is relatively abundant, spatial proteomics data remains scarce due to technical limitations and high costs. To overcome this challenge we propose STProtein, a novel framework leveraging graph neural networks with multi-task learning strategy. STProtein is designed to accurately predict unknown spatial protein expression using more accessible spatial multi-omics data, such as spatial transcriptomics. We believe that STProtein can effectively addresses the scarcity of spatial proteomics, accelerating the integration of spatial multi-omics and potentially catalyzing transformative breakthroughs in life sciences. This tool enables scientists to accelerate discovery by identifying complex and previously hidden spatial patterns of proteins within tissues, uncovering novel relationships between different marker genes, and exploring the biological "Dark Matter".

Abstract: Temporal knowledge graph question answering (TKGQA) aims to answer time-sensitive questions by leveraging temporal knowledge bases. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant potential in TKGQA, current prompting strategies constrain their efficacy in two primary ways. First, they are prone to reasoning hallucinations under complex temporal constraints. Second, static prompting limits model autonomy and generalization, as it lack optimization through dynamic interaction with temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) environments. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{TKG-Thinker}, a novel agent equipped with autonomous planning and adaptive retrieval capabilities for reasoning over TKGs. Specifically, TKG-Thinker performs in-depth temporal reasoning through dynamic multi-turn interactions with TKGs via a dual-training strategy. We first apply Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with chain-of thought data to instill core planning capabilities, followed by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) stage that leverages multi-dimensional rewards to refine reasoning policies under intricate temporal constraints. Experimental results on benchmark datasets with three open-source LLMs show that TKG-Thinker achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits strong generalization across complex TKGQA settings.

Abstract: Floating-point neural networks dominate modern machine learning but incur substantial inference cost, motivating interest in Boolean networks for resource-constrained settings. However, learning compact and accurate Boolean networks is challenging due to their combinatorial nature. In this work, we address this challenge from three different angles: learned connections, compact convolutions and adaptive discretization. First, we propose a novel strategy to learn efficient connections with no additional parameters and negligible computational overhead. Second, we introduce a novel convolutional Boolean architecture that exploits the locality with reduced number of Boolean operations than existing methods. Third, we propose an adaptive discretization strategy to reduce the accuracy drop when converting a continuous-valued network into a Boolean one. Extensive results on standard vision benchmarks demonstrate that the Pareto front of accuracy vs. computation of our method significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art, achieving better accuracy with up to 37x fewer Boolean operations.

OmniVideo-R1 empowers models to "think with omnimodal cues" by two key strategies: (1) query-intensive grounding based on self-supervised learning paradigms; and (2) modality-attentive fusion built upon contrastive learning paradigms. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that OmniVideo-R1 consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting its effectiveness and robust generalization capabilities.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has expanded their capabilities from basic dialogue to advanced scientific reasoning. However, existing benchmarks in biology often fail to assess a critical skill required of researchers: the ability to integrate experimental results with contextual knowledge to derive meaningful conclusions. To address this gap, we introduce BABE(Biology Arena BEnchmark), a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the experimental reasoning capabilities of biological AI systems. BABE is uniquely constructed from peer-reviewed research papers and real-world biological studies, ensuring that tasks reflect the complexity and interdisciplinary nature of actual scientific inquiry. BABE challenges models to perform causal reasoning and cross-scale inference. Our benchmark provides a robust framework for assessing how well AI systems can reason like practicing scientists, offering a more authentic measure of their potential to contribute to biological research.

Abstract: We introduce the Hierarchical Seating Allocation Problem (HSAP) which addresses the optimal assignment of hierarchically structured organizational teams to physical seating arrangements on a floor plan. This problem is driven by the necessity for large organizations with large hierarchies to ensure that teams with close hierarchical relationships are seated in proximity to one another, such as ensuring a research group occupies a contiguous area. Currently, this problem is managed manually leading to infrequent and suboptimal replanning efforts. To alleviate this manual process, we propose an end-to-end framework to solve the HSAP. A scalable approach to calculate the distance between any pair of seats using a probabilistic road map (PRM) and rapidly-exploring random trees (RRT) which is combined with heuristic search and dynamic programming approach to solve the HSAP using integer programming. We demonstrate our approach under different sized instances by evaluating the PRM framework and subsequent allocations both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Model (LLM)-based conversational agents into vehicles creates novel security challenges at the intersection of agentic AI, automotive safety, and inter-agent communication. As these intelligent assistants coordinate with external services via protocols such as Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A), they establish attack surfaces where manipulations can propagate through natural language payloads, potentially causing severe consequences ranging from driver distraction to unauthorized vehicle control. Existing AI security frameworks, while foundational, lack the rigorous "separation of concerns" standard in safety-critical systems engineering by co-mingling the concepts of what is being protected (assets) with how it is attacked (attack paths). This paper addresses this methodological gap by proposing a threat modeling framework called AgentHeLLM (Agent Hazard Exploration for LLM Assistants) that formally separates asset identification from attack path analysis. We introduce a human-centric asset taxonomy derived from harm-oriented "victim modeling" and inspired by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and a formal graph-based model that distinguishes poison paths (malicious data propagation) from trigger paths (activation actions). We demonstrate the framework's practical applicability through an open-source attack path suggestion tool AgentHeLLM Attack Path Generator that automates multi-stage threat discovery using a bi-level search strategy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly become familiar tools to researchers and practitioners. Concepts such as prompting, temperature, or few-shot examples are now widely recognized, and LLMs are increasingly used in Modeling & Simulation (M&S) workflows. However, practices that appear straightforward may introduce subtle issues, unnecessary complexity, or may even lead to inferior results. Adding more data can backfire (e.g., deteriorating performance through model collapse or inadvertently wiping out existing guardrails), spending time on fine-tuning a model can be unnecessary without a prior assessment of what it already knows, setting the temperature to 0 is not sufficient to make LLMs deterministic, providing a large volume of M&S data as input can be excessive (LLMs cannot attend to everything) but naive simplifications can lose information. We aim to provide comprehensive and practical guidance on how to use LLMs, with an emphasis on M&S applications. We discuss common sources of confusion, including non-determinism, knowledge augmentation (including RAG and LoRA), decomposition of M&S data, and hyper-parameter settings. We emphasize principled design choices, diagnostic strategies, and empirical evaluation, with the goal of helping modelers make informed decisions about when, how, and whether to rely on LLMs.

Abstract: This paper addresses the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) by comparing classical and quantum Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches. An Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) agent is implemented in classical, full quantum, and hybrid variants, integrating transformer architectures to capture the relationships between vehicles, clients, and the depot through self- and cross-attention mechanisms. The experiments focus on multi-vehicle scenarios with capacity constraints, considering 20 clients and 4 vehicles, and are conducted over ten independent runs. Performance is assessed using routing distance, route compactness, and route overlap. The results show that all three approaches are capable of learning effective routing policies. However, quantum-enhanced models outperform the classical baseline and produce more robust route organization, with the hybrid architecture achieving the best overall performance across distance, compactness, and route overlap. In addition to quantitative improvements, qualitative visualizations reveal that quantum-based models generate more structured and coherent routing solutions. These findings highlight the potential of hybrid quantum-classical reinforcement learning models for addressing complex combinatorial optimization problems such as the CVRP.

Abstract: The operational effectiveness of digital-twin technology in motorway traffic management depends on the availability of a continuous flow of high-resolution real-time traffic data. To function as a proactive decision-making support layer within traffic management, a digital twin must also incorporate predicted traffic conditions in addition to real-time observations. Due to the spatio-temporal complexity and the time-variant, non-linear nature of traffic dynamics, predicting motorway traffic remains a difficult problem. Sequence-based deep-learning models offer clear advantages over classical machine learning and statistical models in capturing long-range, temporal dependencies in time-series traffic data, yet limitations in forecasting accuracy and model complexity point to the need for further improvements. To improve motorway traffic forecasting, this paper introduces a Geographically-aware Transformer-based Traffic Forecasting GATTF model, which exploits the geographical relationships between distributed sensors using their mutual information (MI). The model has been evaluated using real-time data from the Geneva motorway network in Switzerland and results confirm that incorporating geographical awareness through MI enhances the accuracy of GATTF forecasting compared to a standard Transformer, without increasing model complexity.

Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) research has faced limitations due to the lack of standard and sufficiently large datasets. Recent studies have leveraged pre-trained models to extract features for downstream tasks such as SER. This work explores the capabilities of Whisper, a pre-trained ASR system, in speech emotion recognition by proposing two attention-based pooling methods, Multi-head Attentive Average Pooling and QKV Pooling, designed to efficiently reduce the dimensionality of Whisper representations while preserving emotional features. We experiment on English and Persian, using the IEMOCAP and ShEMO datasets respectively, with Whisper Tiny and Small. Our multi-head QKV architecture achieves state-of-the-art results on the ShEMO dataset, with a 2.47% improvement in unweighted accuracy. We further compare the performance of different Whisper encoder layers and find that intermediate layers often perform better for SER on the Persian dataset, providing a lightweight and efficient alternative to much larger models such as HuBERT X-Large. Our findings highlight the potential of Whisper as a representation extractor for SER and demonstrate the effectiveness of attention-based pooling for dimension reduction.

We introduce AgenticPay, a benchmark and simulation framework for multi-agent buyer-seller negotiation driven by natural language. AgenticPay models markets in which buyers and sellers possess private constraints and product-dependent valuations, and must reach agreements through multi-round linguistic negotiation rather than numeric bidding alone. The framework supports a diverse suite of over 110 tasks ranging from bilateral bargaining to many-to-many markets, with structured action extraction and metrics for feasibility, efficiency, and welfare. Benchmarking state-of-the-art proprietary and open-weight LLMs reveals substantial gaps in negotiation performance and highlights challenges in long-horizon strategic reasoning, establishing AgenticPay as a foundation for studying agentic commerce and language-based market interaction.

Abstract: Virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a powerful tool for evaluating school security measures in high-risk scenarios such as school shootings, offering experimental control and high behavioral fidelity. However, assessing new interventions in VR requires recruiting new participant cohorts for each condition, making large-scale or iterative evaluation difficult. These limitations are especially restrictive when attempting to learn effective intervention strategies, which typically require many training episodes. To address this challenge, we develop a data-driven discrete-event simulator (DES) that models shooter movement and in-region actions as stochastic processes learned from participant behavior in VR studies. We use the simulator to examine the impact of a robot-based shooter intervention strategy. Once shown to reproduce key empirical patterns, the DES enables scalable evaluation and learning of intervention strategies that are infeasible to train directly with human subjects. Overall, this work demonstrates a high-to-mid fidelity simulation workflow that provides a scalable surrogate for developing and evaluating autonomous school-security interventions.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built from prompted large language models can improve multi-round reasoning, yet most existing pipelines rely on fixed, trajectory-wide communication patterns that are poorly matched to the stage-dependent needs of iterative problem solving. We introduce DyTopo, a manager-guided multi-agent framework that reconstructs a sparse directed communication graph at each round. Conditioned on the manager's round goal, each agent outputs lightweight natural-language query (need) and \key (offer) descriptors; DyTopo embeds these descriptors and performs semantic matching, routing private messages only along the induced edges. Across code generation and mathematical reasoning benchmarks and four LLM backbones, DyTopo consistently outperforms over the strongest baseline (avg. +6.2). Beyond accuracy, DyTopo yields an interpretable coordination trace via the evolving graphs, enabling qualitative inspection of how communication pathways reconfigure across rounds.

Abstract: Deep learning models like U-Net and its variants, have established state-of-the-art performance in edge detection tasks and are used by Generative AI services world-wide for their image generation models. However, their decision-making processes remain opaque, operating as "black boxes" that obscure the rationale behind specific boundary predictions. This lack of transparency is a critical barrier in safety-critical applications where verification is mandatory. To bridge the gap between high-performance deep learning and interpretable logic, we propose the Rule-Based Spatial Mixture-of-Experts U-Net (sMoE U-Net). Our architecture introduces two key innovations: (1) Spatially-Adaptive Mixture-of-Experts (sMoE) blocks integrated into the decoder skip connections, which dynamically gate between "Context" (smooth) and "Boundary" (sharp) experts based on local feature statistics; and (2) a Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) Fuzzy Head that replaces the standard classification layer. This fuzzy head fuses deep semantic features with heuristic edge signals using explicit IF-THEN rules. We evaluate our method on the BSDS500 benchmark, achieving an Optimal Dataset Scale (ODS) F-score of 0.7628, effectively matching purely deep baselines like HED (0.7688) while outperforming the standard U-Net (0.7437). Crucially, our model provides pixel-level explainability through "Rule Firing Maps" and "Strategy Maps," allowing users to visualize whether an edge was detected due to strong gradients, high semantic confidence, or specific logical rule combinations.

Abstract: While POD-based surrogates are widely explored for hydrodynamic applications, the use of Koopman Autoencoders for real-world coastal-ocean modelling remains relatively limited. This paper introduces a flexible Koopman autoencoder formulation that incorporates meteorological forcings and boundary conditions, and systematically compares its performance against POD-based surrogates. The Koopman autoencoder employs a learned linear temporal operator in latent space, enabling eigenvalue regularization to promote temporal stability. This strategy is evaluated alongside temporal unrolling techniques for achieving stable and accurate long-term predictions. The models are assessed on three test cases spanning distinct dynamical regimes, with prediction horizons up to one year at 30-minute temporal resolution. Across all cases, the Koopman autoencoder with temporal unrolling yields the best overall accuracy compared to the POD-based surrogates, achieving relative root-mean-squared-errors of 0.01-0.13 and $R^2$-values of 0.65-0.996. Prediction errors are largest for current velocities, and smallest for water surface elevations. Comparing to in-situ observations, the surrogate yields -0.65% to 12% change in water surface elevation prediction error when compared to prediction errors of the physics-based model. These error levels, corresponding to a few centimeters, are acceptable for many practical applications, while inference speed-ups of 300-1400x enables workflows such as ensemble forecasting and long climate simulations for coastal-ocean modelling.

Abstract: Congressional stock trading has raised concerns about potential information asymmetries and conflicts of interest in financial markets. We introduce a temporal graph network (TGN) framework to identify information channels through which members of Congress may possess advantageous knowledge when trading company stocks. We construct a multimodal dynamic graph integrating diverse publicly available datasets, including congressional stock transactions, lobbying relationships, campaign finance contributions, and geographical connections between legislators and corporations. Our approach formulates the detection problem as a dynamic edge classification task, where we identify trades that exhibit statistically significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 across long time horizons. To handle the temporal nature of these relationships, we develop a two-step walk-forward validation architecture that respects information availability constraints and prevents look-ahead bias. We evaluate several labeling strategies based on risk-adjusted returns and demonstrate that the TGN successfully captures complex temporal dependencies between congressional-corporate interactions and subsequent trading performance.

Abstract: Path marginal cost (PMC) is a crucial component in solving path-based system-optimal dynamic traffic assignment (SO-DTA), dynamic origin-destination demand estimation (DODE), and network resilience analysis. However, accurately evaluating PMC in heterogeneous traffic conditions poses significant challenges. Previous studies often focus on homogeneous traffic flow of single vehicle class and do not well address the interactive effect of heterogeneous traffic flows and the resultant computational issues. This study proposes a novel but simple method for approximately evaluating PMC in complex heterogeneous traffic condition. The method decomposes PMC into intra-class and inter-class terms and uses conversion factor derived from heterogeneous link dynamics to explicitly model the intricate relationships between vehicle classes. Additionally, the method considers the non-differentiable issue that arises when mixed traffic flow approaches system optimum conditions. The proposed method is tested on a small corridor network with synthetic demand and a large-scale network with calibrated demand from real-world data. Results demonstrated that our method exhibits superior performance in solving bi-class SO-DTA problems, yielding lower total travel cost and capturing the multi-class flow competition at the system optimum state.

Abstract: Financial time series are commonly decomposed into market factors, which capture shared price movements across assets, and residual factors, which reflect asset-specific deviations. To hedge the market-wide risks, such as the COVID-19 shock, trading strategies that exploit residual factors have been shown to be effective. However, financial time series often exhibit near-singular eigenstructures, which hinder the stable and accurate estimation of residual factors. This paper proposes a method for extracting residual factors from financial time series that hierarchically applies principal component analysis (PCA) and Gaussian graphical model (GGM). Our hierarchical approach balances stable estimation with elimination of factors that PCA alone cannot fully remove, enabling efficient extraction of residual factors. We use multivariate totally positive of order 2 (MTP2)-constrained GGM to capture the predominance of positive correlations in financial data. Our analysis proves that the resulting residual factors exhibit stronger orthogonality than those obtained with PCA alone. Across multiple experiments with varying test periods and training set lengths, the proposed method consistently achieved superior orthogonality of the residual factors. Backtests on the S&P 500 and TOPIX 500 constituents further indicate improved trading performance, including higher Sharpe ratios.

Abstract: This paper introduces a material-aware strength-of-connection measure for smoothed aggregation algebraic multigrid methods, aimed at improving robustness for scalar partial differential equations with heterogeneous and anisotropic material properties. Classical strength-of-connection measures typically rely only on matrix entries or geometric distances, which often fail to capture weak couplings across material interfaces or align with anisotropy directions, ultimately leading to poor convergence. The proposed approach directly incorporates material tensor information into the coarsening process, enabling a reliable detection of weak connections and ensuring that coarse levels preserve the true structure of the underlying problem. As a result, smooth error components are represented properly and sharp coefficient jumps or directional anisotropies are handled consistently. A wide range of academic tests and real-world applications, including thermally activated batteries and solar cells, demonstrate that the proposed method maintains robustness across material contrasts, anisotropies, and mesh variations. Scalability and parallel performance of the algebraic multigrid method highlight the suitability for large-scale, high-performance computing environments.

Abstract: This study is a first step towards using data-informed differential models to predict and control the dynamics of cancer-on-chip experiments. We consider a conceptualized one-dimensional device, containing a cancer and a population of white blood cells. The interaction between the cancer and the population of cells is modeled by a chemotaxis model inspired by Keller-Segel-type equations, which is solved by a Hybridized Discontinuous Galerkin method. Our goal is using (synthetic) data to tune the parameters of the governing equations and to assess the uncertainty on the predictions of the dynamics due to the residual uncertainty on the parameters remaining after the tuning procedure. To this end, we apply techniques from uncertainty quantification for parametric differential models. We first perform a global sensitivity analysis using both Sobol and Morris indices to assess how parameter uncertainty impacts model predictions, and fix the value of parameters with negligible impact. Subsequently, we conduct an inverse uncertainty quantification analysis by Bayesian techniques to compute a data-informed probability distribution of the remaining model parameters. Finally, we carry out a forward uncertainty quantification analysis to compute the impact of the updated (residual) parametric uncertainties on the quantities of interest of the model. The whole procedure is sped up by using surrogate models, based on sparse-grids, to approximate the mapping of the uncertain parameters to the quantities of interest.
