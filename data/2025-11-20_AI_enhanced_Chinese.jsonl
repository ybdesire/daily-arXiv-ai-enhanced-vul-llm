Bimanual psychomotor proficiency is fundamental to neurosurgical procedures, yet it remains difficult for trainees to acquire and for educators to objectively evaluate performance. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of a neurosurgical simulation platform that integrates an anatomically realistic brain model with surgical instrument tracking to support training and objective assessment of bimanual tasks in the context of subpial corticectomy. Methods. We developed and evaluated a neurosurgical simulation platform based on an ex-vivo calf brain model and a multi-camera tracking system capable of simultaneously capturing the motion of surgical instruments in both hands, including collection of real-time instrument trajectories and synchronized video recordings. These enabled extraction of motion-based, time-based, and bimanual coordination metrics. We conducted a case series involving 47 participants across four training levels: medical students, junior residents, senior residents, and neurosurgeons. Results. The tracking system successfully captured instrument motion during 81% of the periods when instruments were actively used throughout the simulation procedure. Several extracted metrics were able to significantly differentiate between levels of surgical expertise. In particular, instrument usage duration and custom-defined bimanual coordination metrics such as instrument tip separation distance and simultaneous usage time, show potential as features to identify participant expertise levels with different instruments. Conclusions. We demonstrated the feasibility of tracking surgical instruments during complex bimanual tasks in an ex-vivo brain simulation platform. The metrics developed provide a foundation for objective performance assessment and highlight the potential of motion analysis to improve neurosurgical training and evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u795e\u7ecf\u5916\u79d1\u6a21\u62df\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ffd\u8e2a\u53cc\u624b\u624b\u672f\u5668\u68b0\u8fd0\u52a8\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u53cc\u4efb\u52a1\u64cd\u4f5c\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6c34\u5e73\u5916\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u7684\u5ba2\u89c2\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u53cc\u4efb\u52a1\u64cd\u4f5c\u719f\u7ec3\u5ea6\u5bf9\u795e\u7ecf\u5916\u79d1\u624b\u672f\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5b66\u5458\u96be\u4ee5\u638c\u63e1\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5ba2\u89c2\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u79bb\u4f53\u5c0f\u725b\u8111\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u591a\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u53d1\u6a21\u62df\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u8fd0\u52a8\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u53cc\u624b\u534f\u8c03\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u6d89\u53ca47\u540d\u4e0d\u540c\u57f9\u8bad\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u3002", "result": "\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6210\u529f\u6355\u83b781%\u7684\u5668\u68b0\u4f7f\u7528\u65f6\u6bb5\uff0c\u591a\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u533a\u5206\u5916\u79d1\u4e13\u4e1a\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5668\u68b0\u4f7f\u7528\u65f6\u957f\u548c\u53cc\u624b\u534f\u8c03\u6307\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u79bb\u4f53\u8111\u6a21\u62df\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d\u8ffd\u8e2a\u590d\u6742\u53cc\u4efb\u52a1\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5ba2\u89c2\u7ee9\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u8fd0\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u6539\u5584\u795e\u7ecf\u5916\u79d1\u57f9\u8bad\u3002"}}

However, the transparency of cross-chain messages can inadvertently expose sensitive transaction information, creating opportunities for adversaries to exploit value through manipulation or front-running strategies.\n  In this work, we investigate cross-chain sandwich attacks targeting liquidity pool-based cross-chain bridge protocols. We uncover a critical vulnerability where attackers can exploit events emitted on the source chain to learn transaction details on the destination chain before they appear in the destination chain mempool. This information advantage allows attackers to strategically place front-running and back-running transactions, ensuring that their front-running transactions always precede those of existing MEV bots monitoring the mempool of the destination chain. Moreover, current sandwich-attack defenses are ineffective against this new cross-chain variant. To quantify this threat, we conduct an empirical study using two months (August 10 to October 10, 2025) of cross-chain transaction data from the Symbiosis protocol and a tailored heuristic detection model.

In practice, however, many real-world exits violate these assumptions by splitting the attack across both time and actor dimensions: attackers break total extraction into many low-impact trades and route proceeds through multiple non-owner addresses, producing low-visibility drains.\n  We formalize this family of attacks as the fragmented rug pull (FRP) and offer a compact recipe for a slow-stewed beef special: (i) keep the lid on (to preserve LP control so on-chain extraction remains feasible), (ii) chop thin slices (to split the total exit volume into many low-impact micro-trades that individually fall below impact thresholds), and (iii) pass the ladle (to delegate sells across multiple wallets so that each participant takes a small share of the extraction). Technically, we define three atomic predicate groups and show that their orthogonal combinations yield evasive strategies overlooked by prior heuristics (USENIX Sec 19, USENIX Sec 23).\n  We validate the model with large-scale measurements. Our corpus contains 303,614 LPs, among which 105,434 are labeled as FRP pools. The labeled subset includes 34,192,767 pool-related transactions and 401,838 inflated-seller wallets, involving 1,501,408 unique interacting addresses. Notably, owner-wallet participation in inflated selling among FRP-flagged LPs has declined substantially (33.1% of cases), indicating a shift in scam behavior: the liquidity drain is no longer held on the owner wallet. We also detected 127,252 wallets acting as serial scammers when repeatedly engaging in inflated selling across multiple FRP LPs.

However, progress in this domain has been hindered by the limited availability of public, labelled datasets. We present an open source framework combining a service report validated public dataset, an evaluation method based on Accuracy, Reliability, and Earliness, and baseline results implemented with EnergyFaultDetector, an open source Python framework.\n  The dataset contains time series of operational data from 93 substations across two manufacturers, annotated with a list of disturbances due to faults and maintenance actions, a set of normal-event examples and detailed fault metadata. We evaluate the EnergyFaultDetector using three metrics: Accuracy for recognising normal behaviour, an eventwise F Score for reliable fault detection with few false alarms, and Earliness for early detection. The framework also supports root cause analysis using ARCANA. We demonstrate three use cases to assist operators in interpreting anomalies and identifying underlying faults. The models achieve high normal-behaviour accuracy (0.98) and eventwise F-score (beta=0.5) of 0.83, detecting 60% of the faults in the dataset before the customer reports a problem, with an average lead time of 3.9 days.\n  Integrating an open dataset, metrics, open source code, and baselines establishes a reproducible, fault centric benchmark with operationally meaningful evaluation, enabling consistent comparison and development of early fault detection and diagnosis methods for district heating substations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5df2\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u533a\u57df\u4f9b\u6696\u7ad9\u6545\u969c\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u533a\u57df\u4f9b\u6696\u7ad9\u6545\u969c\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5bf9\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u516c\u5f00\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u670d\u52a1\u62a5\u544a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u65e9\u671f\u6027\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528EnergyFaultDetector\u5f00\u6e90Python\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6b63\u5e38\u884c\u4e3a\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6(0.98)\u548c\u4e8b\u4ef6F\u5206\u6570(0.83)\uff0c60%\u6545\u969c\u5728\u5ba2\u6237\u62a5\u544a\u524d\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u524d3.9\u5929\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5f00\u6e90\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u533a\u57df\u4f9b\u6696\u7ad9\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f00\u53d1\u3002"}}

The framework records and replays agent interactions, supports out-of-band queries into each agent's beliefs and rationale, and enables counterfactual evidence injection to test how belief structures respond to new information. We apply the framework to a medical case simulator notable for its multi-agent shared memory (a time-stamped electronic medical record, or EMR) and an oracle agent (the LabAgent) that holds ground truth lab results revealed only when explicitly queried. We stress-test the system on a multi-specialty diagnostic journey for a child with an abrupt-onset neuropsychiatric presentation. Large language model agents, each primed with strong role-specific priors (\"act like a neurologist\", \"act like an infectious disease specialist\"), write to a shared medical record and interact with a moderator across sequential or parallel encounters. Breakpoints at key diagnostic moments enable pre- and post-event belief queries, allowing us to distinguish entrenched priors from reasoning or evidence-integration effects. The simulation reveals that agent beliefs often mirror real-world disciplinary stances, including overreliance on canonical studies and resistance to counterevidence, and that these beliefs can be traced and interrogated in ways not possible with human experts.

However, this memory introduces critical risks when sensitive information is revealed in inappropriate contexts. We present CIMemories, a benchmark for evaluating whether LLMs appropriately control information flow from memory based on task context. CIMemories uses synthetic user profiles with over 100 attributes per user, paired with diverse task contexts in which each attribute may be essential for some tasks but inappropriate for others. Our evaluation reveals that frontier models exhibit up to 69% attribute-level violations (leaking information inappropriately), with lower violation rates often coming at the cost of task utility. Violations accumulate across both tasks and runs: as usage increases from 1 to 40 tasks, GPT-5's violations rise from 0.1% to 9.6%, reaching 25.1% when the same prompt is executed 5 times, revealing arbitrary and unstable behavior in which models leak different attributes for identical prompts. Privacy-conscious prompting does not solve this - models overgeneralize, sharing everything or nothing rather than making nuanced, context-dependent decisions.

This version corresponds to the paper accepted for presentation at CASCON 2025", "summary": "Manual grading of programming assignments in introductory computer science courses can be time-consuming and prone to inconsistencies. While unit testing is commonly used for automatic evaluation, it typically follows a binary pass/fail model and does not give partial marks. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer the potential for automated, scalable, and more objective grading.\n  This paper compares two AI-based grading techniques: \\textit{Direct}, where the AI model applies a rubric directly to student code, and \\textit{Reverse} (a newly proposed approach), where the AI first fixes errors, then deduces a grade based on the nature and number of fixes. Each method was evaluated on both the instructor's original grading scale and a tenfold expanded scale to assess the impact of range on AI grading accuracy. To assess their effectiveness, AI-assigned scores were evaluated against human tutor evaluations on a range of coding problems and error types.\n  Initial findings suggest that while the Direct approach is faster and straightforward, the Reverse technique often provides a more fine-grained assessment by focusing on correction effort. Both methods require careful prompt engineering, particularly for allocating partial credit and handling logic errors. To further test consistency, we also used synthetic student code generated using Gemini Flash 2.0, which allowed us to evaluate AI graders on a wider range of controlled error types and difficulty levels. We discuss the strengths and limitations of each approach, practical considerations for prompt design, and future directions for hybrid human-AI grading systems that aim to improve consistency, efficiency, and fairness in CS courses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e24\u79cdAI\u8bc4\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u53cd\u5411\u8bc4\u5206\u3002\u76f4\u63a5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba9AI\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u53cd\u5411\u65b9\u6cd5\u5148\u4fee\u590d\u9519\u8bef\u518d\u8bc4\u5206\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u76f4\u63a5\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u53cd\u5411\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u66f4\u7ec6\u81f4\u3002\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u90fd\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u3002", "motivation": "\u624b\u52a8\u8bc4\u5206\u7f16\u7a0b\u4f5c\u4e1a\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u5bb9\u6613\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u6709\u901a\u8fc7/\u4e0d\u901a\u8fc7\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u7ed9\u51fa\u90e8\u5206\u5206\u6570\u3002\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u66f4\u5ba2\u89c2\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e24\u79cdAI\u8bc4\u5206\u6280\u672f\uff1a\u76f4\u63a5\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u53cd\u5411\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u539f\u59cb\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u8bc4\u5206\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u4f7f\u7528AI\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u4ee3\u7801\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u76f4\u63a5\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5feb\u66f4\u76f4\u63a5\uff0c\u53cd\u5411\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5173\u6ce8\u4fee\u6b63\u5de5\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u90fd\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5206\u914d\u90e8\u5206\u5206\u6570\u548c\u5904\u7406\u903b\u8f91\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u6bcf\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u7f3a\u70b9\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u8003\u8651\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u672a\u6765\u6df7\u5408\u4eba\u673a\u8bc4\u5206\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002"}}

Retraining is limited by the cost and time of manual labeling or sandbox analysis. Existing approaches mitigate this via drift detection and selective labeling, but fully label-free adaptation remains largely unexplored. Recent self-training methods use a previously trained model to generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled data and then train a new model on these labels. The unlabeled data are used only for inference and do not participate in training the earlier model. We argue that these unlabeled samples still carry valuable information that can be leveraged when incorporated appropriately into training. This paper introduces LFreeDA, an end-to-end framework that adapts malware classifiers to drift without manual labeling or drift detection. LFreeDA first performs unsupervised domain adaptation on malware images, jointly training on labeled and unlabeled samples to infer pseudo-labels and prune noisy ones. It then adapts a classifier on CFG representations using the labeled and selected pseudo-labeled data, leveraging the scalability of images for pseudo-labeling and the richer semantics of CFGs for final adaptation. Evaluations on the real-world MB-24+ dataset show that LFreeDA improves accuracy by up to 12.6% and F1 by 11.1% over no-adaptation lower bounds, and is only 4% and 3.4% below fully supervised upper bounds in accuracy and F1, respectively. It also matches the performance of state-of-the-art methods provided with ground truth labels for 300 target samples.

We share the insights and lessons learned from deployment of the tool - in production since March 2024 - scaled across 70 software products, processing over 2000 tickets for issue diagnosis, achieving a time savings of 300+ man hours and an estimated $15,444 per month in manpower costs compared to the traditional log analysis practices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65e5\u5fd7\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u53ef\u5728CPU\u4e0a\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u6d77\u91cf\u65e5\u5fd7\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u603b\u7ed3\uff0c\u5728\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u8282\u7701\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u4eba\u529b\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "IT\u73af\u5883\u4ea7\u751f\u5927\u91cf\u65e5\u5fd7\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4eba\u5de5\u68c0\u67e5\u4e0d\u73b0\u5b9e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65e5\u5fd7\u5206\u6790\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65e5\u5fd7\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u65b0\u9896\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728CPU\u4e0a\u9ad8\u6548\u8fd0\u884cLLM\u5904\u7406\u65e5\u5fd7\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5de5\u5177\u81ea2024\u5e743\u6708\u90e8\u7f72\u81f370\u4e2a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4ea7\u54c1\uff0c\u5904\u74062000\u591a\u5f20\u5de5\u5355\uff0c\u8282\u7701300+\u4eba\u5de5\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0c\u6bcf\u6708\u4f30\u8ba1\u8282\u770115,444\u7f8e\u5143\u4eba\u529b\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u65e5\u5fd7\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347IT\u652f\u6301\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

The imprecise Bayesian formulation produces interval-valued, uncertainty-aware estimates of representativeness, rather than a single value.

GeoShield leverages the property that CPS are designed to tolerate brief disruptions and maintain safety, as long as they recover (i.e., resume normal operations or transition to a safe mode) within a bounded amount of time following a fault. Instead of masking faults, it detects them and recovers the system within bounded time, thus guaranteeing safety with much fewer resources. GeoShield introduces protocols for Byzantine fault-resilient network measurement and inter-region omission fault detection that proactively detect malicious message delays, along with recovery mechanisms that guarantee timely recovery while maximizing operational robustness. It is the first bounded-time recovery solution that operates effectively under unreliable networks without relying on trusted hardware.

While major security scanners focus on identifying known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) in open-source packages, there are very few studies on detecting malicious packages. Malicious open-source package detection typically requires static, dynamic analysis, or both. Dynamic analysis is more effective as it can expose a package's behaviors at runtime. However, current dynamic analysis tools (e.g., ossf's package-analysis) lack an automatic method to differentiate malicious packages from benign packages. In this paper, we propose an approach to extract the features from dynamic analysis (e.g., executed commands) and leverage machine learning techniques to automatically classify packages as benign or malicious. Our evaluation of nearly 2000 packages on npm shows that the machine learning classifier achieves an AUC of 0.91 with a false positive rate of nearly 0%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u53d6\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u6076\u610f\u5f00\u6e90\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5305\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728npm\u5305\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u52300.91\u7684AUC\u548c\u63a5\u8fd10%\u7684\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u6076\u610f\u5f00\u6e90\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5305\u6570\u91cf\u6fc0\u589e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u626b\u63cf\u5668\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5df2\u77e5CVE\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6076\u610f\u5305\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6790\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6790\uff08\u5982\u6267\u884c\u7684\u547d\u4ee4\uff09\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5305\u8fdb\u884c\u826f\u6027\u6216\u6076\u6027\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8fd12000\u4e2anpm\u5305\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684AUC\u8fbe\u52300.91\uff0c\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u63a5\u8fd10%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u6076\u610f\u5f00\u6e90\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5305\uff0c\u4e3a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u5b89\u5168\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In particular, they have shown great promise in generating sequence diagrams for software engineering, typically represented in a text-based syntax such as Mermaid. However, systematic evaluations in this space remain underdeveloped as there is a lack of existing benchmarks to assess the LLM's correctness in this task. To address this shortcoming, we introduce MermaidSeqBench, a human-verified and LLM-synthetically-extended benchmark for assessing an LLM's capabilities in generating Mermaid sequence diagrams from textual prompts. The benchmark consists of a core set of 132 samples, starting from a small set of manually crafted and verified flows. These were expanded via a hybrid methodology combining human annotation, in-context LLM prompting, and rule-based variation generation. Our benchmark uses an LLM-as-a-judge model to assess Mermaid sequence diagram generation across fine-grained metrics, including syntax correctness, activation handling, error handling, and practical usability. We perform initial evaluations on numerous state-of-the-art LLMs and utilize multiple LLM judge models to demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of our benchmark.

Although reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved superhuman performance in many domains, relatively little attention has been focused on designing human-like RL agents. As a result, many reward-driven RL agents often exhibit unnatural behaviors compared to humans, raising concerns for both interpretability and trustworthiness. To achieve human-like behavior in RL, this paper first formulates human-likeness as trajectory optimization, where the objective is to find an action sequence that closely aligns with human behavior while also maximizing rewards, and adapts the classic receding-horizon control to human-like learning as a tractable and efficient implementation. To achieve this, we introduce Macro Action Quantization (MAQ), a human-like RL framework that distills human demonstrations into macro actions via Vector-Quantized VAE. Experiments on D4RL Adroit benchmarks show that MAQ significantly improves human-likeness, increasing trajectory similarity scores, and achieving the highest human-likeness rankings among all RL agents in the human evaluation study. Our results also demonstrate that MAQ can be easily integrated into various off-the-shelf RL algorithms, opening a promising direction for learning human-like RL agents.

Developing these systems more efficiently and safely can be achieved by employing actionable, software-based models. From a high-level system model, engineers often need to derive multiple specialized models for different purposes, including simulation, deployment, and formal verification. Each of these target models usually rely on its own formalism, specification language, and execution platform. Traditionally, a compiler analyzes a program written in a programming language and generates executable code. In contrast, a model compiler processes a source model written in a modeling language and should ideally support the generation of multiple heterogeneous targets. However, most existing modeling languages are designed with a narrow focus, typically targeting only simulation or implementation. Multi-target compilation, when not considered during the language's early design, becomes significantly harder to achieve. In this paper, we introduce our initiative: a toolchain and modeling language called M, designed to support system modeling and multi-target compilation for model-driven engineering of complex, concurrent, and time-aware systems. M is a textual, grammar-driven language based on the actor model and extended with discrete-event scheduling semantics. It provides constructs for modeling system entities, message-based interactions, and time- or state-triggered reactions. From such models, M enables the systematic generation of diverse target artifacts while preserving semantic conformance to the original model.

To address these issues, we propose an innovative framework, HIN-LLM Synergistic Enhanced Knowledge Tracing (HISE-KT), which seamlessly integrates HINs with LLMs. HISE-KT first builds a multi-relationship HIN containing diverse node types to capture the structural relations through multiple meta-paths. The LLM is then employed to intelligently score and filter meta-path instances and retain high-quality paths, pioneering automated meta-path quality assessment. Inspired by educational psychology principles, a similar student retrieval mechanism based on meta-paths is designed to provide a more valuable context for prediction. Finally, HISE-KT uses a structured prompt to integrate the target student's history with the retrieved similar trajectories, enabling the LLM to generate not only accurate predictions but also evidence-backed, explainable analysis reports.

While Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) offer potential solutions for detecting such violations, existing approaches face critical limitations and challenges due to LLMs' inherent overconfidence, limited access to ground truth training data, and reliance on empirically determined thresholds.\n  We present COPYCHECK, a novel framework that leverages uncertainty signals to detect whether copyrighted content was used in LLM training sets. Our method turns LLM overconfidence from a limitation into an asset by capturing uncertainty patterns that reliably distinguish between ``seen\" (training data) and ``unseen\" (non-training data) content. COPYCHECK further implements a two-fold strategy: (1) strategic segmentation of files into smaller snippets to reduce dependence on large-scale training data, and (2) uncertainty-guided unsupervised clustering to eliminate the need for empirically tuned thresholds. Experiment results show that COPYCHECK achieves an average balanced accuracy of 90.1% on LLaMA 7b and 91.6% on LLaMA2 7b in detecting seen files. Compared to the SOTA baseline, COPYCHECK achieves over 90% relative improvement, reaching up to 93.8\\% balanced accuracy.

Traditional machine learning approaches for phishing detection often require extensive feature engineering, continuous retraining, and costly infrastructure maintenance. At the same time, proprietary large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in phishing-related classification tasks, but their operational costs and reliance on external providers limit their practical adoption in many business environments. This paper investigates the feasibility of small language models (SLMs) for detecting phishing websites using only their raw HTML code. A key advantage of these models is that they can be deployed on local infrastructure, providing organisations with greater control over data and operations. We systematically evaluate 15 commonly used Small Language Models (SLMs), ranging from 1 billion to 70 billion parameters, benchmarking their classification accuracy, computational requirements, and cost-efficiency. Our results highlight the trade-offs between detection performance and resource consumption, demonstrating that while SLMs underperform compared to state-of-the-art proprietary LLMs, they can still provide a viable and scalable alternative to external LLM services.

Using a mutation testing approach, we introduce faults (mutations) into the code and rely on formal specifications for detecting them.

In addition, we synthesize new operators tailored for Dafny from bugfix commits in publicly available Dafny projects on GitHub. Drawing from both, we equipped our tool with a total of 32 mutation operators.

Through an analysis of current debates in AI research, we demonstrate how the conceptions remain largely implicit yet fundamentally shape how empirical evidence gets interpreted across a wide range of areas. These underlying views generate fundamentally different research approaches across three areas. Methodologically, they produce different approaches to model selection, benchmark design, and experimental validation. Interpretively, they lead to contradictory readings of the same empirical phenomena, from capability emergence to system limitations.

Meanwhile, humans exhibit a complementary set of thinking abilities when addressing such tasks, whereas existing methods typically cover only a subset of these dimensions. Inspired by this, we propose Octopus: Agentic Multimodal Reasoning with Six-Capability Orchestration, a new paradigm for multimodal agentic reasoning.

A CCE is a single environment in which multiple canonical RL challenges (e.g., partial observability, credit assignment, representation learning, enormous action spaces, etc.) arise simultaneously. Mastery therefore demands integrated, long-horizon understanding across many interacting variables. We emphasize that this definition excludes challenges that only aggregate unrelated tasks in independent, parallel streams (e.g., learning to play all Atari games at once). These aggregated multitask benchmarks primarily asses whether an agent can catalog and switch among unrelated policies rather than test an agent's ability to perform deep reasoning across many interacting challenges.", "AI": {"tldr": "Terra Nova is a comprehensive challenge environment based on Civilization V that integrates multiple RL challenges simultaneously, requiring agents to demonstrate deep reasoning across interacting variables rather than just multitasking.", "motivation": "To create an environment where canonical RL challenges like partial observability, credit assignment, and large action spaces arise together, testing integrated understanding rather than parallel task switching.", "method": "Developing a single, unified environment inspired by Civilization V that naturally combines multiple interdependent RL challenges in a complex, interactive system.", "result": "The introduction of Terra Nova as a new benchmark that demands long-horizon reasoning across many interacting variables, distinguishing it from multitask environments with independent tasks.", "conclusion": "Terra Nova provides a more meaningful testbed for evaluating RL agents' ability to handle complex, interconnected challenges compared to aggregated multitask benchmarks."}}

Existing methods lack deep semantic insight. To address this, we propose the Transaction Intent Mining (TIM) framework. TIM leverages a DeFi intent taxonomy built on grounded theory and a multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) system to robustly infer user intents. A Meta-Level Planner dynamically coordinates domain experts to decompose multiple perspective-specific intent analyses into solvable subtasks. Question Solvers handle the tasks with multi-modal on/off-chain data. While a Cognitive Evaluator mitigates LLM hallucinations and ensures verifiability. Experiments show that TIM significantly outperforms machine learning models, single LLMs, and single Agent baselines. We also analyze core challenges in intent inference.

However, the field is still in its infancy, and the key factors driving the success or failure of agent trajectories are not fully understood. We examine the role that ideation diversity plays in agent performance. First, we analyse agent trajectories on MLE-bench, a well-known benchmark to evaluate AI research agents, across different models and agent scaffolds. Our analysis reveals that different models and agent scaffolds yield varying degrees of ideation diversity, and that higher-performing agents tend to have increased ideation diversity. Further, we run a controlled experiment where we modify the degree of ideation diversity, demonstrating that higher ideation diversity results in stronger performance. Finally, we strengthen our results by examining additional evaluation metrics beyond the standard medal-based scoring of MLE-bench, showing that our findings still hold across other agent performance metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper examines how ideation diversity affects AI research agent performance on the MLE-bench benchmark, finding that higher diversity correlates with better results.", "motivation": "AI research agents could accelerate science but their success factors are unclear; this study investigates the role of ideation diversity.", "method": "Analyzed agent trajectories on MLE-bench across models/scaffolds, ran controlled experiments manipulating ideation diversity, and used multiple evaluation metrics.", "result": "Higher ideation diversity consistently correlated with improved agent performance across different models and evaluation metrics.", "conclusion": "Ideation diversity is a key factor in AI research agent success, suggesting it should be prioritized in agent design."}}
