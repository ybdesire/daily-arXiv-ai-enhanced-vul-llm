Traditional settlement mechanisms rely on multiple intermediaries and manual procedures, resulting in settlement periods exceeding 120 days with operational costs consuming approximately 5 percent of total revenue. This research presents a blockchain-anchored audit trail model enabling transparent, immutable, and automated inter-operator settlement. The framework leverages distributed ledger technology, smart contract automation, and cryptographic verification to establish a unified, tamper-proof transaction record. Empirical evaluation demonstrates 87 percent reduction in transaction fees, settlement cycle compression from 120 days to 3 minutes, and 100 percent audit trail integrity. Smart contract automation reduces manual intervention by 92 percent and eliminates 88 percent of settlement disputes. Market analysis indicates institutional adoption accelerated from 8 percent in 2020 to 52 percent by April 2024, with projected industry investment reaching 9.2 billion USD annually.

In real deployments, providers distribute a global model to many edge devices, where each client personalizes the model using private data. When a deletion request is issued, clients may ignore it or falsely claim compliance, and providers cannot check their parameters or data. This makes verification difficult, especially because personalized models must forget the targeted samples while preserving local utility, and verification must remain lightweight on edge devices.\n  We introduce ZK APEX, a zero-shot personalized unlearning method that operates directly on the personalized model without retraining. ZK APEX combines sparse masking on the provider side with a small Group OBS compensation step on the client side, using a blockwise empirical Fisher matrix to create a curvature-aware update designed for low overhead. Paired with Halo2 zero-knowledge proofs, it enables the provider to verify that the correct unlearning transformation was applied without revealing any private data or personalized parameters.\n  On Vision Transformer classification tasks, ZK APEX recovers nearly all personalization accuracy while effectively removing the targeted information. Applied to the OPT125M generative model trained on code data, it recovers around seventy percent of the original accuracy. Proof generation for the ViT case completes in about two hours, more than ten million times faster than retraining-based checks, with less than one gigabyte of memory use and proof sizes around four hundred megabytes. These results show the first practical framework for verifiable personalized unlearning on edge devices."}

CIDP breaks this deadlock by injecting physical-layer entropy via rapid antenna sidelobe modulation, enabling near-isochronous, low-overhead anonymous communication. CIDP jointly designs: (a) a Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty network controller that stabilizes queues and maximizes entropy injection; (b) a robust discrete-time Control Barrier Function (RaCBF) filter that provably enforces deterministic jitter bounds for real-time flows despite uncertainty; and (c) a convex Sidelobe Time Modulation (SLTM) optimization that spreads signals into the antenna null-space to mask transmissions. We explicitly augment the classical anonymity bound with a physical-layer equivocation term, showing that rapidly changing sidelobes contribute additional secrecy. Consequently, as the injected physical entropy grows, both latency and dummy overhead can approach zero for a fixed anonymity target. We provide full theoretical proofs of queue stability, barrier-set invariance, and SLTM convexity. Moreover, we quantitatively benchmark our SLTM design against recent LPI/LPD schemes, demonstrating significantly lower intercept probability for comparable overhead. High-fidelity MATLAB/NS-3 simulations and an FPGA prototype validate CIDP: results show approximately 40% larger anonymity sets and 100% compliance with sub-30 ms jitter (compared to a Tor-like baseline), with only about 5% throughput loss. We also outline a Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA) and FOCI-compliant supply-chain strategy. CIDP is the first architecture that simultaneously addresses strong anonymity, strict isochrony, and spectral efficiency with provable guarantees, making it highly relevant for sovereign JADC2 deployments."}

The system's core innovation is its ability to adapt to five key aspects of the learning context: indicators of struggle, mastery patterns, topic progression history, session boundaries, and learning progression signals.

While deep learning offers promising alternatives, existing methods often struggle with flexibility and generalization, particularly on unstructured meshes, which significantly limits their practical applicability. To address these challenges, we propose PhysGTO, an efficient Graph-Transformer Operator for learning physical dynamics through explicit manifold embeddings in both physical and latent spaces. In the physical space, the proposed Unified Graph Embedding module aligns node-level conditions and constructs sparse yet structure-preserving graph connectivity to process heterogeneous inputs. In the latent space, PhysGTO integrates a lightweight flux-oriented message-passing scheme with projection-inspired attention to capture local and global dependencies, facilitating multilevel interactions among complex physical correlations. This design ensures linear complexity relative to the number of mesh points, reducing both the number of trainable parameters and computational costs in terms of floating-point operations (FLOPs), and thereby allowing efficient inference in real-time applications. We introduce a comprehensive benchmark spanning eleven datasets, covering problems with unstructured meshes, transient flow dynamics, and large-scale 3D geometries. PhysGTO consistently achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while significantly reducing computational costs, demonstrating superior flexibility, scalability, and generalization in a wide range of simulation tasks."}

By leveraging the computational advantages of quantum devices, QFL offers significant improvements in learning efficiency and resilience against quantum-era threats. However, future 6G environments are expected to be highly dynamic, decentralized, and data-intensive, which necessitates moving beyond traditional centralized federated learning frameworks. To meet this demand, blockchain technology provides a decentralized, tamper-resistant infrastructure capable of enabling trustless collaboration among distributed quantum edge devices. This paper presents QFLchain, a novel framework that integrates QFL with blockchain to support scalable and secure 6G intelligence. In this work, we investigate four key pillars of \\textit{QFLchain} in the 6G context: (i) communication and consensus overhead, (ii) scalability and storage overhead, (iii) energy inefficiency, and (iv) security vulnerability.

High-mix discrete manufacturing systems require jointly optimizing mid-term production planning and machine-level scheduling under heterogeneous resources and stringent delivery commitments. We address this problem with a profit-driven integrated framework that couples a mixed-integer planning model with a machine-level scheduling heuristic. The planning layer allocates production, accessory co-production, and outsourcing under aggregate economic and capacity constraints, while the scheduling layer refines these allocations using a structure-aware procedure that enforces execution feasibility and stabilizes daily machine behavior. This hierarchical design preserves the tractability of aggregated optimization while capturing detailed operational restrictions. Evaluations are conducted on a real industrial scenario. A flexible machine-level execution scheme yields 73.3% on-time completion and significant outsourcing demand, revealing bottleneck congestion. In contrast, a stability-enforcing execution policy achieves 100% on-time completion, eliminates all outsourcing, and maintains balanced machine utilization with only 1.9 to 4.6% capacity loss from changeovers. These results show that aligning planning decisions with stability-oriented execution rules enables practical and interpretable profit-maximizing decisions in complex manufacturing environments."}

Protecting PII data has become increasingly important in today's digital age, and several regulations have been formulated to ensure the secure exchange and management of sensitive personal data. However, at times some of these regulations are at loggerheads with each other, like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Cures Act; and this adds complexity to the already challenging task of Health Data compliance. As public concern regarding sensitive data breaches grows, finding solutions that streamline compliance processes and enhance individual privacy is crucial. We have developed a novel TRUsted Compliance Enforcement (TRUCE) framework for secure data exchange which aims to automate compliance procedures and enhance trusted data management within organizations. The TRUCE framework reasons over contexts of data exchange and assesses the trust score of users and the veracity of data based on corresponding regulations. This framework, developed using approaches from AI/Knowledge representation and Semantic Web technologies, includes a trust management method that incorporates static ground truth, represented by regulations such as HIPAA, and dynamic ground truth, defined by an organization's policies. In this paper, we present our framework in detail along with the validation against the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Data Usage Agreement (DUA) on CDC Contact Tracing patient data, up to one million patient records.

In the first stage, we employ large language models (LLMs) to independently evaluate retrieved articles and compute an aggregated agreement score that reflects the overall evidence stance. When this score indicates insufficient consensus-falling below a predefined threshold-the system proceeds to a second stage. Multiple agents engage in structured debate to synthesize conflicting evidence and generate well-reasoned verdicts with explicit justifications. Experimental results demonstrate that our two-stage approach achieves superior performance compared to baseline methods, highlighting the value of combining automated scoring with collaborative reasoning for complex verification tasks."}

But this benchmark may overlap with model training data. If that is true, scores may reflect training recall, not issue-solving skill. To study this, we test two Claude models that frequently appear in top-performing agents submitted to the benchmark. We ask them to find relevant files using only issue text, and then issue text plus file paths. We then run the same setup on BeetleBox and SWE-rebench. Despite both benchmarks involving popular open-source Python projects, models performed 3 times better on SWE-Bench-Verified. They were also 6 times better at finding edited files, without any additional context about the projects themselves. This gap suggests the models may have seen many SWE-Bench-Verified tasks during training. As a result, scores on this benchmark may not reflect an agent's ability to handle real software issues, yet it continues to be used in ways that can misrepresent progress and lead to choices that favour agents that use certain models over strong agent design. Our setup tests the localization step with minimal context to the extent that the task should be logically impossible to solve.

To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-Layer Robust Crop Planning Framework (MLRCPF) that integrates spatial reasoning, temporal dynamics, and robust optimization. Specifically, we formalize crop-to-crop relationships through a structured interaction matrix embedded within the state-transition logic, and employ a distributionally robust optimization layer to mitigate worst-case risks defined by a data-driven ambiguity set. Evaluations on a real-world high-mix farming dataset from North China demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The framework autonomously generates sustainable checkerboard rotation patterns that restore soil fertility, significantly increasing the legume planting ratio compared to deterministic baselines. Economically, it successfully resolves the trade-off between optimality and stability. These results highlight the importance of explicitly encoding domain-specific structural priors into optimization models for resilient decision-making in complex agricultural systems."}

We evaluate Echo-CoPilot on the public MIMIC-EchoQA benchmark, where it achieves an accuracy of 50.8\\%, outperforming both general-purpose and biomedical video vision-language models. Qualitative analyses further show that the agent leverages quantitative measurements and physiologic context to resolve challenging cases near clinical decision thresholds, such as borderline left ventricular hypertrophy or pericardial effusion severity.

Classical $r$-adaptivity optimizes vertex positions but requires solving expensive auxiliary PDEs such as the Monge-Ampère equation, while classical $h$-adaptivity modifies topology through element subdivision but suffers from expensive error indicator computation and is constrained by isotropic refinement patterns that impose accuracy ceilings. Combined $hr$-adaptive techniques naturally outperform single-modality approaches, yet inherit both computational bottlenecks and the restricted cost-accuracy trade-off. Emerging machine learning methods for adaptive mesh refinement seek to overcome these limitations, but existing approaches address $h$-adaptivity or $r$-adaptivity in isolation. We present HypeR, a deep reinforcement learning framework that jointly optimizes mesh relocation and refinement. HypeR casts the joint adaptation problem using tools from hypergraph neural networks and multi-agent reinforcement learning. Refinement is formulated as a heterogeneous multi-agent Markov decision process (MDP) where element agents decide discrete refinement actions, while relocation follows an anisotropic diffusion-based policy on vertex agents with provable prevention of mesh tangling. The reward function combines local and global error reduction to promote general accuracy. Across benchmark PDEs, HypeR reduces approximation error by up to 6--10$\\times$ versus state-of-art $h$-adaptive baselines at comparable element counts, breaking through the uniform refinement accuracy ceiling that constrains subdivision-only methods. The framework produces meshes with improved shape metrics and alignment to solution anisotropy, demonstrating that jointly learned $hr$-adaptivity strategies can substantially enhance the capabilities of automated mesh generation."}

In this paper, we introduce, BinSeek, the first two-stage cross-modal retrieval framework for stripped binary code analysis. It consists of two models: BinSeekEmbedding is trained on large-scale dataset to learn the semantic relevance of the binary code and the natural language description, furthermore, BinSeek-Reranker learns to carefully judge the relevance of the candidate code to the description with context augmentation. To this end, we built an LLM-based data synthesis pipeline to automate training construction, also deriving a domain benchmark for future research. Our evaluation results show that BinSeek achieved the state-of-the-art performance, surpassing the the same scale models by 31.42% in Rec@3 and 27.17% in MRR@3, as well as leading the advanced general-purpose models that have 16 times larger parameters."}

The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) serves as the primary public transportation system in the Greater Boston Area, with the Green Line representing one of the oldest and most complex rapid transit systems in the network. This paper presents a network-based risk and resilience assessment of the MBTA Green Line using graph theory, network metrics, and the Model-Based Risk Analysis (MBRA) tool. The original 70-station Green Line network is simplified into a 17-node model, and key metrics, including degree centrality, betweenness centrality, eigenvector centrality, spectral radius, node robustness, and blocking nodes, are computed using Python-based analysis. Critical vulnerability is derived using the MBRA resiliency equation, and random, targeted, and cyber-physical attack scenarios are evaluated. The results identify North Station, Government Center, Haymarket, Copley, and Kenmore as the most critical nodes. A fault tree analysis between Kenmore and Copley further demonstrates the impact of budget allocation on threat reduction. This work highlights key vulnerabilities in the Green Line network and provides actionable recommendations to improve resilience against cyber-physical threats."}

In this paper, we present the first large-scale study of jailbreaking LLM-based automated code evaluators in academic context. Our contributions are: (i) We systematically adapt 20+ jailbreaking strategies for jailbreaking AI code evaluators in the academic context, defining a new class of attacks termed academic jailbreaking. (ii) We release a poisoned dataset of 25K adversarial student submissions, specifically designed for the academic code-evaluation setting, sourced from diverse real-world coursework and paired with rubrics and human-graded references, and (iii) In order to capture the multidimensional impact of academic jailbreaking, we systematically adapt and define three jailbreaking metrics (Jailbreak Success Rate, Score Inflation, and Harmfulness). (iv) We comprehensively evalulate the academic jailbreaking attacks using six LLMs. We find that these models exhibit significant vulnerability, particularly to persuasive and role-play-based attacks (up to 97% JSR).

This paper proposes LLMPEA, an LLM-based framework to detect phishing email attacks across multiple attack vectors, including prompt injection, text refinement, and multilingual attacks. We evaluate three frontier LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 4, and Grok-3) and comprehensive prompting design to assess their feasibility, robustness, and limitations against phishing email attacks. Our empirical analysis reveals that LLMs can detect the phishing email over 90% accuracy while we also highlight that LLM-based phishing email detection systems could be exploited by adversarial attack, prompt injection, and multilingual attacks.

Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether existing approaches can effectively leverage such hybrid queries, particularly in cross-language contexts. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study of representative code models and reveal three challenges: (1) insufficient semantic understanding; (2) inefficient fusion in hybrid code retrieval; and (3) weak generalization in cross-language scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose UniCoR, a novel self-supervised framework that learns Unified Code Representations framework designed to learn unified and robust code representations. Firstly, we design a multi-perspective supervised contrastive learning module to enhance semantic understanding and modality fusion. It aligns representations from multiple perspectives, including code-to-code, natural language-to-code, and natural language-to-natural language, enforcing the model to capture a semantic essence among modalities. Secondly, we introduce a representation distribution consistency learning module to improve cross-language generalization, which explicitly aligns the feature distributions of different programming languages, enabling language-agnostic representation learning. Extensive experiments on both empirical benchmark and large-scale benchmark show that UniCoR outperforms all baseline models, achieving an average improvement of 8.64% in MRR and 11.54% in MAP over the best-performing baseline. Furthermore, UniCoR exhibits stability in hybrid code retrieval and generalization capability in cross-language scenarios."}

Unlike prior studies limited to lab setups, we implement a complete proof-of-concept in a factory environment and compare WireGuard with IPsec under industrial traffic conditions. Our approach successfully protects user data (N3 interface) against untrusted gNBs and man-in-the-middle attacks while enabling control plane (N2 interface) authentication between the access and mobility management functions (AMF) and gNB. Performance measurements show that WireGuard adds minimal overhead in throughput, latency, and Central Processing Unit (CPU) usage, achieving performance comparable to IPsec.

Built on Unreal Engine 5, SWR procedurally generates unlimited photorealistic urban scenes populated with dynamic elements such as pedestrians and traffic systems, surpassing prior urban simulations in realism, complexity, and scalability. It also supports multi-robot control and communication. With these key features, we build two challenging robot benchmarks: (1) a multimodal instruction-following task, where a robot must follow vision-language navigation instructions to reach a destination in the presence of pedestrians and traffic; and (2) a multi-agent search task, where two robots must communicate to cooperatively locate and meet each other.

While datasets such as LMSYS-Chat-1M and WildChat capture real-world user-LLM conversations, few studies systematically explore the mechanisms of human-LLM collaboration in coding scenarios. What tortuous paths do users experience during the interaction process? How well do the LLMs follow instructions? Are users satisfied? In this paper, we conduct an empirical analysis on human-LLM coding collaboration using LMSYS-Chat-1M and WildChat datasets to explore the human-LLM collaboration mechanism, LLMs' instruction following ability, and human satisfaction. This study yields interesting findings: 1) Task types shape interaction patterns(linear, star and tree), with code quality optimization favoring linear patterns, design-driven tasks leaning toward tree structures, and queries preferring star patterns; 2) Bug fixing and code refactoring pose greater challenges to LLMs' instruction following, with non-compliance rates notably higher than in information querying; 3) Code quality optimization and requirements-driven development tasks show lower user satisfaction, whereas structured knowledge queries and algorithm designs yield higher levels. These insights offer recommendations for improving LLM interfaces and user satisfaction in coding collaborations, while highlighting avenues for future research on adaptive dialogue systems. We believe this work broadens understanding of human-LLM synergies and supports more effective AI-assisted development."}

Specifically, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) have forced the community to focus on users' data privacy. Despite the vast amount of data on developer issues available in GitHub repositories, there is a lack of empirical evidence on the issues developers of Open Source Software discuss to comply with privacy legislation. Method: In this work, we examine such discussions by mining and analyzing 32,820 issues from GitHub repositories. We partially analyzed the dataset automatically to identify law user rights and principles indicated, and manually analyzed a sample of 1,186 issues based on the type of concern addressed. Results: We devised 24 discussion categories placed in six clusters: features/bugs, consent-related, documentation, data storing/sharing, adaptability, and general compliance. Our results show that developers mainly focus on specific user rights from the legislation (right to erasure, right to opt-out, right to access), addressing other rights less frequently, while most discussions concern user consent, user rights functionality, bugs and cookies management. Conclusion: The created taxonomy can help practitioners understand which issues are discussed for law compliance, so that they ensure they address them first in their systems. In addition, the educational community can reshape curricula to better educate future engineers on the privacy law concerns raised, and the research community can identify gaps and areas for improvement to support and accelerate data privacy law compliance."}

By modeling IAM logs as heterogeneous dynamic graphs, the proposed system captures temporal, relational, and contextual dependencies across entities such as users, roles, sessions, and access actions. The model incorporates attention based aggregation and graph embedding updates to enable continual adaptation to changing cloud environments. Experimental evaluation on synthesized and real world IAM datasets demonstrates that the proposed method achieves higher detection precision and recall than baseline LSTM and GCN classifiers, while maintaining scalability across multi tenant cloud environments.

Pathways Towards Unifying AI Safety and Ethics Research", "comment": "Accepted for presentation at IASEAI 2026", "summary": "While much research in artificial intelligence (AI) has focused on scaling capabilities, the accelerating pace of development makes countervailing work on producing harmless, \"aligned\" systems increasingly urgent. Yet research on alignment has diverged along two largely parallel tracks: safety--centered on scaled intelligence, deceptive or scheming behaviors, and existential risk--and ethics--focused on present harms, the reproduction of social bias, and flaws in production pipelines. Although both communities warn of insufficient investment in alignment, they disagree on what alignment means or ought to mean. As a result, their efforts have evolved in relative isolation, shaped by distinct methodologies, institutional homes, and disciplinary genealogies.\n  We present a large-scale, quantitative study showing the structural split between AI safety and AI ethics. Using a bibliometric and co-authorship network analysis of 6,442 papers from twelve major ML and NLP conferences (2020-2025), we find that over 80% of collaborations occur within either the safety or ethics communities, and cross-field connectivity is highly concentrated: roughly 5% of papers account for more than 85% of bridging links. Removing a small number of these brokers sharply increases segregation, indicating that cross-disciplinary exchange depends on a handful of actors rather than broad, distributed collaboration. These results show that the safety-ethics divide is not only conceptual but institutional, with implications for research agendas, policy, and venues. We argue that integrating technical safety work with normative ethics--via shared benchmarks, cross-institutional venues, and mixed-method methodologies--is essential for building AI systems that are both robust and just."}

PACIFIC produces benchmark variants with clearly defined expected outputs, enabling straightforward and reliable evaluation through simple output comparisons. In contrast to existing approaches that often rely on tool usage or agentic behavior, our work isolates and evaluates the LLM's intrinsic ability to reason through code behavior step-by-step without execution (dry running) and to follow instructions. Furthermore, our framework mitigates training data contamination by facilitating effortless generation of novel benchmark variations. We validate our framework by generating a suite of benchmarks spanning a range of difficulty levels and evaluating multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results demonstrate that PACIFIC can produce increasingly challenging benchmarks that effectively differentiate instruction-following and dry running capabilities, even among advanced models.

However, FL remains susceptible to privacy threats that can compromise data via direct means.

If leaked, this information can enable next-level attacks tailored to the architecture. This paper proposes a novel side-channel fingerprinting attack, leveraging flow-level and packet-level statistics of encrypted wireless traffic from an FL client to infer its deep learning model architecture. We name it FLARE, a fingerprinting framework based on FL Architecture REconnaissance. Evaluation across various CNN and RNN variants-including pre-trained and custom models trained over IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi-shows that FLARE achieves over 98% F1-score in closed-world and up to 91% in open-world scenarios. These results reveal that CNN and RNN models leak distinguishable traffic patterns, enabling architecture fingerprinting even under realistic FL settings with hardware, software, and data heterogeneity.

We first probe residual streams across layers of four open transformer-based LLMs (Magistral 24B, Qwen3 14B, GPT-OSS 20B, OLMo2-1B) prompted with explicit demographic disclosure. We show that the same probes predict demographics from implicit cues: names activate census-aligned gender and race representations, while occupations trigger representations correlated with real-world workforce statistics. These linear representations allow us to explain demographic inferences implicitly formed by LLMs during conversation. We demonstrate that these implicit demographic representations actively shape downstream behavior, such as career recommendations. Our study further highlights that models that pass bias benchmark tests may still harbor and leverage implicit biases, with implications for fairness when applied at scale."}

Evaluation on five Go vulnerabilities demonstrates that panic-reachability gating achieves 1.8-3.9x speedups when filtering 33-70% of branches, and that Zorya detects all panics while existing tools detect at most two. Function-mode analysis proved essential for complex programs, running roughly two orders of magnitude faster than starting from main. This work establishes that specialized concolic execution can achieve practical vulnerability detection in language ecosystems with runtime safety checks."}

However, serverless cloud users remain vulnerable to various types of attacks, including micro-architectural side-channel attacks. These attacks typically rely on the physical co-location of victim and attacker instances, and attackers will need to exploit cloud schedulers to achieve co-location with victims. Therefore, it is crucial to study vulnerabilities in serverless cloud schedulers and assess the security of different serverless scheduling algorithms. This study addresses the gap in understanding and constructing co-location attacks in serverless clouds. We present a comprehensive methodology to uncover exploitable features in serverless scheduling algorithms and devise strategies for constructing co-location attacks through normal user interfaces. In our experiments, we successfully reveal exploitable vulnerabilities and achieve instance co-location on prevalent open-source infrastructures and Microsoft Azure Functions. We also present a mitigation strategy to defend against co-location attacks in serverless clouds. Our work highlights critical areas for security enhancements in current cloud schedulers, offering insights to fortify serverless computing environments against potential co-location attacks."}

Current methods often rely on costly LLM-based techniques (e.g. annotating dataset differences) or dense embedding models (e.g. for clustering), which lack control over the properties of interest. We propose using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to create SAE embeddings: representations whose dimensions map to interpretable concepts. Through four data analysis tasks, we show that SAE embeddings are more cost-effective and reliable than LLMs and more controllable than dense embeddings. Using the large hypothesis space of SAEs, we can uncover insights such as (1) semantic differences between datasets and (2) unexpected concept correlations in documents. For instance, by comparing model responses, we find that Grok-4 clarifies ambiguities more often than nine other frontier models. Relative to LLMs, SAE embeddings uncover bigger differences at 2-8x lower cost and identify biases more reliably. Additionally, SAE embeddings are controllable: by filtering concepts, we can (3) cluster documents along axes of interest and (4) outperform dense embeddings on property-based retrieval. Using SAE embeddings, we study model behavior with two case studies: investigating how OpenAI model behavior has changed over time and finding \"trigger\" phrases learned by Tulu-3 (Lambert et al., 2024) from its training data. These results position SAEs as a versatile tool for unstructured data analysis and highlight the neglected importance of interpreting models through their data."}

Internet of Things and Cloud computing integrated systems (IoT-Cloud) facilitate sensing, automation, and processing for these healthcare applications. While real-time response is crucial for alleviating patient emergencies, protecting patient privacy is extremely important in data-driven healthcare. In this paper, we propose a multi-layer IoT, Edge and Cloud architecture to enhance the speed of response for emergency healthcare by distributing tasks based on response criticality and permanence of storage. Privacy of patient data is assured by proposing a Differential Privacy framework across several machine learning models such as K-means, Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Naive Bayes. We establish a comprehensive threat model identifying three adversary classes and evaluate Laplace, Gaussian, and hybrid noise mechanisms across varying privacy budgets, with supervised algorithms achieving up to 86% accuracy. The proposed hybrid Laplace-Gaussian noise mechanism with adaptive budget allocation provides a balanced approach, offering moderate tails and better privacy-utility trade-offs for both low and high dimension datasets. At the practical threshold of $\\varepsilon = 5.0$, supervised algorithms achieve 82-84% accuracy while reducing attribute inference attacks by up to 18% and data reconstruction correlation by 70%.

This work analyzes conspiratorial narratives in Singapore-based Telegram groups, showing that such content is woven into everyday discussions rather than confined to isolated echo chambers. We propose a two-stage computational framework. First, we fine-tune RoBERTa-large to classify messages as conspiratorial or not, achieving an F1-score of 0.866 on 2,000 expert-labeled messages. Second, we build a signed belief graph in which nodes represent messages and edge signs reflect alignment in belief labels, weighted by textual similarity. We introduce a Signed Belief Graph Neural Network (SiBeGNN) that uses a Sign Disentanglement Loss to learn embeddings that separate ideological alignment from stylistic features.\n  Using hierarchical clustering on these embeddings, we identify seven narrative archetypes across 553,648 messages: legal topics, medical concerns, media discussions, finance, contradictions in authority, group moderation, and general chat. SiBeGNN yields stronger clustering quality (cDBI = 8.38) than baseline methods (13.60 to 67.27), supported by 88 percent inter-rater agreement in expert evaluations. Our analysis shows that conspiratorial messages appear not only in clusters focused on skepticism or distrust, but also within routine discussions of finance, law, and everyday matters. These findings challenge common assumptions about online radicalization by demonstrating that conspiratorial discourse operates within ordinary social interaction. The proposed framework advances computational methods for belief-driven discourse analysis and offers applications for stance detection, political communication studies, and content moderation policy."}

While modern defensive architectures often employ Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) to identify malicious activity, the effectiveness of these systems against Layer 2 wireless threats remains a subject of critical inquiry. This project aimed to design a stealth-capable Rogue AP and evaluate its detectability against Suricata, an open-source NIDS/IPS. The methodology initially focused on a hardware-based deployment using Raspberry Pi platforms but transitioned to a virtualized environment due to severe system compatibility issues. Using Wifipumpkin3, the research team successfully deployed a captive portal that harvested user credentials from connected devices.

We introduce AgriRegion, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework designed specifically for high-fidelity, region-aware agricultural advisory. Unlike standard RAG approaches that rely solely on semantic similarity, AgriRegion incorporates a geospatial metadata injection layer and a region-prioritized re-ranking mechanism. By restricting the knowledge base to verified local agricultural extension services and enforcing geo-spatial constraints during retrieval, AgriRegion ensures that the advice regarding planting schedules, pest control, and fertilization is locally accurate. We create a novel benchmark dataset, AgriRegion-Eval, which comprises 160 domain-specific questions across 12 agricultural subfields. Experiments demonstrate that AgriRegion reduces hallucinations by 10-20% compared to state-of-the-art LLMs systems and significantly improves trust scores according to a comprehensive evaluation."}

This paper proposes an evaluation framework for CRs, emphasizing mission-critical settings by using a multi-criteria decision-making approach. We define a set of evaluation criteria that capture technical fidelity, training and assessment capabilities, scalability, usability, and other relevant factors. To weight and aggregate these criteria, we employ the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), supported by a simulated panel of multidisciplinary experts implemented through a Large Language Model (LLM). This LLM-assisted expert reasoning enables consistent and reproducible pairwise comparisons across criteria without requiring direct expert convening.

In particular, the scheme utilizes a backdoor learning framework to intrinsically lock a model's utility, such that it performs normally only in the presence of a specific trigger (e.g., a hardware fingerprint). But in its absence, the DNN's performance degrades to be useless. To further enhance the security of the proposed authority scheme, the certifiable robustness is integrated to prevent an adaptive attacker from removing the implanted backdoor. The resulting framework establishes a secure authority mechanism for DNNs, combining access control with certifiable robustness against adversarial attacks.

We introduce Neuronal Attention Circuit (NAC), a novel, biologically plausible CT-Attention mechanism that reformulates attention logits computation as the solution to a linear first-order ODE with nonlinear interlinked gates derived from repurposing \\textit{C. elegans} Neuronal Circuit Policies (NCPs) wiring mechanism. NAC replaces dense projections with sparse sensory gates for key-query projections and a sparse backbone network with two heads for computing \\textit{content-target} and \\textit{learnable time-constant} gates, enabling efficient adaptive dynamics. NAC supports three attention logit computation modes: (i) explicit Euler integration, (ii) exact closed-form solution, and (iii) steady-state approximation. To improve memory intensity, we implemented a sparse Top-\\emph{K} pairwise concatenation scheme that selectively curates key-query interactions. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees, including state stability, bounded approximation errors, and universal approximation. Empirically, we implemented NAC in diverse domains, including irregular time-series classification, lane-keeping for autonomous vehicles, and industrial prognostics. We observed that NAC matches or outperforms competing baselines in accuracy and occupies an intermediate position in runtime and memory efficiency compared with several CT baselines."}

The purpose is to encourage bridge participation for higher decentralization and lower single-point-of-failure risks. The mathematical analysis and simulation results validate the effectiveness of PSCRD using two key metrics: the Gini index, which demonstrates a progressive improvement in the fairness of the reward distribution as new bridge groups joined the network; and the Nakamoto coefficient, which shows a significant improvement in decentralization over time. These findings highlight that PSCRD provides a more resilient and secure cross-chain bridge system without substantially increasing user costs."}

In this paper, we propose a novel interpretability framework to systematically analyze the internal mechanisms of VLMs, focusing on the functional roles of attention heads in multimodal reasoning. To this end, we introduce CogVision, a dataset that decomposes complex multimodal questions into step-by-step subquestions designed to simulate human reasoning through a chain-of-thought paradigm, with each subquestion associated with specific receptive or cognitive functions such as high-level visual reception and inference. Using a probing-based methodology, we identify attention heads that specialize in these functions and characterize them as functional heads. Our analysis across diverse VLM families reveals that these functional heads are universally sparse, vary in number and distribution across functions, and mediate interactions and hierarchical organization. Furthermore, intervention experiments demonstrate their critical role in multimodal reasoning: removing functional heads leads to performance degradation, while emphasizing them enhances accuracy. These findings provide new insights into the cognitive organization of VLMs and suggest promising directions for designing models with more human-aligned perceptual and reasoning abilities."}

However, in Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) such as Intel SGX, the time source is outside the Trusted Computing Base: a malicious host can manipulate the TEE's notion of time, jumping in time or affecting perceived time speed. Previous work (Triad) proposes protocols for TEEs to maintain a trustworthy time source by building a cluster of TEEs that collaborate with each other and with a remote Time Authority to maintain a continuous notion of passing time. However, such approaches still allow an attacker to control the operating system and arbitrarily manipulate their own TEE's perceived clock speed. An attacker can even propagate faster passage of time to honest machines participating in Triad's trusted time protocol, causing them to skip to timestamps arbitrarily far in the future. We propose TriHaRd, a TEE trusted time protocol achieving high resilience against clock speed and offset manipulations, notably through Byzantine-resilient clock updates and consistency checks. We empirically show that TriHaRd mitigates known attacks against Triad."}

Unfortunately, recent jailbreaking attacks have shown that adversarial prompts can effectively bypass these mechanisms and induce T2I models to produce sensitive content, revealing critical safety vulnerabilities. However, existing attack methods implicitly assume that the attacker knows the type of deployed defenses, which limits their effectiveness against unknown or diverse defense mechanisms. In this work, we introduce \\textbf{MJA}, a \\textbf{m}etaphor-based \\textbf{j}ailbreaking \\textbf{a}ttack method inspired by the Taboo game, aiming to effectively and efficiently attack diverse defense mechanisms without prior knowledge of their type by generating metaphor-based adversarial prompts. Specifically, MJA consists of two modules: an LLM-based multi-agent generation module~(MLAG) and an adversarial prompt optimization module~(APO). MLAG decomposes the generation of metaphor-based adversarial prompts into three subtasks: metaphor retrieval, context matching, and adversarial prompt generation. Subsequently, MLAG coordinates three LLM-based agents to generate diverse adversarial prompts by exploring various metaphors and contexts. To enhance attack efficiency, APO first trains a surrogate model to predict the attack results of adversarial prompts and then designs an acquisition strategy to adaptively identify optimal adversarial prompts. Extensive experiments on T2I models with various external and internal defense mechanisms demonstrate that MJA outperforms six baseline methods, achieving stronger attack performance while using fewer queries.

While collaborative perception mitigates the limitations of single-agent perception through information sharing, it encounters a fundamental communication-performance trade-off. Existing communication-efficient approaches typically assume MB-level data transmission per collaboration, which may fail due to practical network constraints. To address these issues, we propose InfoCom, an information-aware framework establishing the pioneering theoretical foundation for communication-efficient collaborative perception via extended Information Bottleneck principles. Departing from mainstream feature manipulation, InfoCom introduces a novel information purification paradigm that theoretically optimizes the extraction of minimal sufficient task-critical information under Information Bottleneck constraints. Its core innovations include: i) An Information-Aware Encoding condensing features into minimal messages while preserving perception-relevant information; ii) A Sparse Mask Generation identifying spatial cues with negligible communication cost; and iii) A Multi-Scale Decoding that progressively recovers perceptual information through mask-guided mechanisms rather than simple feature reconstruction. Comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that InfoCom achieves near-lossless perception while reducing communication overhead from megabyte to kilobyte-scale, representing 440-fold and 90-fold reductions per agent compared to Where2comm and ERMVP, respectively."}

General Scene Adaptation for VLN (GSA-VLN) shifts the focus from zero-shot generalization to continual, environment-specific adaptation, narrowing the gap between static benchmarks and real-world deployment. However, current GSA-VLN frameworks exclude user feedback, relying solely on unsupervised adaptation from repeated environmental exposure. In practice, user feedback offers natural and valuable supervision that can significantly enhance adaptation quality. We introduce a user-feedback-driven adaptation framework that extends GSA-VLN by systematically integrating human interactions into continual learning. Our approach converts user feedback-navigation instructions and corrective signals-into high-quality, environment-aligned training data, enabling efficient and realistic adaptation. A memory-bank warm-start mechanism further reuses previously acquired environmental knowledge, mitigating cold-start degradation and ensuring stable redeployment. Experiments on the GSA-R2R benchmark show that our method consistently surpasses strong baselines such as GR-DUET, improving navigation success and path efficiency. The memory-bank warm start stabilizes early navigation and reduces performance drops after updates. Results under both continual and hybrid adaptation settings confirm the robustness and generality of our framework, demonstrating sustained improvement across diverse deployment conditions."}

A widely used approach is the ratio-of-densities method, which defines a time-indexed target path by reweighting probability-density trajectories from multiple models with positive, or in some cases, negative exponents. This construction, however, harbors a critical and previously unformalized failure mode: Marginal Path Collapse, where intermediate densities become non-normalizable even though endpoints remain valid. Collapse arises systematically when composing heterogeneous models trained on different noise schedules or datasets, including a common setting in molecular design where de-novo, conformer, and pocket-conditioned models must be combined for tasks such as flexible-pose scaffold decoration. We provide a novel and complete solution for the problem. First, we derive a simple path existence criterion that predicts exactly when collapse occurs from noise schedules and exponents alone. Second, we introduce Adaptive path Correction with Exponents (ACE), which extends Feynman-Kac steering to time-varying exponents and guarantees a valid probability path. On a synthetic 2D benchmark and on flexible-pose scaffold decoration, ACE eliminates collapse and enables high-guidance compositional generation, improving distributional and docking metrics over constant-exponent baselines and even specialized task-specific scaffold decoration models. Our work turns ratio-of-densities steering with heterogeneous experts from an unstable heuristic into a reliable tool for controllable generation."}

Federated unlearning has therefore emerged as a research frontier, aiming to remove a specific party's contribution from the learned model while preserving the utility of the remaining parties. However, most unlearning techniques focus on Horizontal Federated Learning (HFL), where data are partitioned by samples. In contrast, Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) allows organizations that possess complementary feature spaces to train a joint model without sharing raw data. The resulting feature-partitioned architecture renders HFL-oriented unlearning methods ineffective. In this paper, we propose REMISVFU, a plug-and-play representation misdirection framework that enables fast, client-level unlearning in splitVFL systems. When a deletion request arrives, the forgetting party collapses its encoder output to a randomly sampled anchor on the unit sphere, severing the statistical link between its features and the global model. To maintain utility for the remaining parties, the server jointly optimizes a retention loss and a forgetting loss, aligning their gradients via orthogonal projection to eliminate destructive interference. Evaluations on public benchmarks show that REMISVFU suppresses back-door attack success to the natural class-prior level and sacrifices only about 2.5% points of clean accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines."}

To address this challenge, we propose EmerFlow, a novel LLM-empowered representation learning framework that generates distinctive embeddings for emerging items. It first enriches the raw features of emerging items through LLM reasoning, then aligns these representations with the embedding space of the existing recommendation model. Finally, new interactions are incorporated through meta-learning to refine the embeddings. This enables EmerFlow to learn expressive embeddings for emerging items from only limited interactions. Extensive experiments across diverse domains, including movies and pharmaceuticals, show that EmerFlow consistently outperforms existing methods."}

Considering existing RL- based finetuning methods, entropy intervention turns out to be an effective way to benefit exploratory ability, thereby improving policy performance. Notably, most existing stud- ies intervene in entropy by simply controlling the update of specific tokens during policy optimization of RL. They ig- nore the entropy intervention during the RL sampling that can boost the performance of GRPO by improving the di- versity of responses. In this paper, we propose Selective- adversarial Entropy Intervention, namely SaEI, which en- hances policy entropy by distorting the visual input with the token-selective adversarial objective coming from the en- tropy of sampled responses. Specifically, we first propose entropy-guided adversarial sampling (EgAS) that formu- lates the entropy of sampled responses as an adversarial ob- jective. Then, the corresponding adversarial gradient can be used to attack the visual input for producing adversarial samples, allowing the policy model to explore a larger an- swer space during RL sampling.

A dynamic memory mechanism enables InternGeometry to conduct more than two hundred interactions with the symbolic engine per problem. To further accelerate learning, we introduce Complexity-Boosting Reinforcement Learning (CBRL), which gradually increases the complexity of synthesized problems across training stages. Built on InternThinker-32B, InternGeometry solves 44 of 50 IMO geometry problems (2000-2024), exceeding the average gold medalist score (40.9), using only 13K training examples, just 0.004% of the data used by AlphaGeometry 2, demonstrating the potential of LLM agents on expert-level geometry tasks. InternGeometry can also propose novel auxiliary constructions for IMO problems that do not appear in human solutions. We will release the model, data, and symbolic engine to support future research."}

NormCode enforces a strict separation between semantic operations (LLMdriven reasoning, nondeterministic) and syntactic operations (deterministic data restructuring), enabling precise cost and reliability tracing. The language exists in three isomorphic formats: .ncds for human authoring, .ncd for machine execution, and .ncn for human verification, supporting progressive formalization from sketch to production. We validate NormCode through two demonstrations: (1) a base X addition algorithm achieving 100 percent accuracy on arbitrary length inputs, and (2) self hosted execution of NormCode's own five phase compiler pipeline. The working orchestrator provides dependency driven scheduling, SQLite backed checkpointing, and loop management, making AI workflows auditable by design and addressing a critical need for transparency in high stakes domains such as legal reasoning, medical decision making, and financial analysis."}

To bridge the gap, we propose Phythesis, a novel framework that synergizes large language models (LLMs) and physics-guided evolutionary optimization to automate simulation-ready (SimReady) scene synthesis for energy-efficient DC design.

Although a range of clustering methods have been developed, most focus exclusively on intrinsic cellular structure and ignore the pivotal role of cell-gene associations, which limits their ability to distinguish closely related cell types. To this end, we propose a Refinement Contrastive Learning framework (scRCL) that explicitly incorporates cell-gene interactions to derive more informative representations. Specifically, we introduce two contrastive distribution alignment components that reveal reliable intrinsic cellular structures by effectively exploiting cell-cell structural relationships. Additionally, we develop a refinement module that integrates gene-correlation structure learning to enhance cell embeddings by capturing underlying cell-gene associations. This module strengthens connections between cells and their associated genes, refining the representation learning to exploiting biologically meaningful relationships. Extensive experiments on several single-cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in cell-type identification accuracy. Moreover, downstream biological analyses confirm that the recovered cell populations exhibit coherent gene-expression signatures, further validating the biological relevance of our approach.

We introduce CAPTAIN, a training-free framework that mitigates memorization by directly modifying latent features during denoising. CAPTAIN first applies frequency-based noise initialization to reduce the tendency to replicate memorized patterns early in the denoising process. It then identifies the optimal denoising timesteps for feature injection and localizes memorized regions. Finally, CAPTAIN injects semantically aligned features from non-memorized reference images into localized latent regions, suppressing memorization while preserving prompt fidelity and visual quality. Our experiments show that CAPTAIN achieves substantial reductions in memorization compared to CFG-based baselines while maintaining strong alignment with the intended prompt."}

By incorporating intermediate exit branches into the architecture, they provide less computation for simpler samples, which is particularly beneficial for resource-constrained devices where energy consumption is crucial. However, designing early-exit networks is a challenging and time-consuming process due to the need to balance efficiency and performance. Recent works have utilized Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to design more efficient early-exit networks, aiming to reduce average latency while improving model accuracy by determining the best positions and number of exit branches in the architecture. Another important factor affecting the efficiency and accuracy of early-exit networks is the depth and types of layers in the exit branches. In this paper, we use hardware-aware NAS to strengthen exit branches, considering both accuracy and efficiency during optimization. Our performance evaluation on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN datasets demonstrates that our proposed framework, which considers varying depths and layers for exit branches along with adaptive threshold tuning, designs early-exit networks that achieve higher accuracy with the same or lower average number of MACs compared to the state-of-the-art approaches."}

However, millions use LLMs for personal advice on high-stakes topics like finance and health, where harms are context-dependent rather than universal. While frameworks like the OECD's AI classification recognize the need to assess individual risks, user-welfare safety evaluations remain underdeveloped. We argue that developing such evaluations is non-trivial due to fundamental questions about accounting for user context in evaluation design. In this exploratory study, we evaluated advice on finance and health from GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro across user profiles of varying vulnerability. First, we demonstrate that evaluators must have access to rich user context: identical LLM responses were rated significantly safer by context-blind evaluators than by those aware of user circumstances, with safety scores for high-vulnerability users dropping from safe (5/7) to somewhat unsafe (3/7). One might assume this gap could be addressed by creating realistic user prompts containing key contextual information. However, our second study challenges this: we rerun the evaluation on prompts containing context users report they would disclose, finding no significant improvement. Our work establishes that effective user-welfare safety evaluation requires evaluators to assess responses against diverse user profiles, as realistic user context disclosure alone proves insufficient, particularly for vulnerable populations. By demonstrating a methodology for context-aware evaluation, this study provides both a starting point for such assessments and foundational evidence that evaluating individual welfare demands approaches distinct from existing universal-risk frameworks. We publish our code and dataset to aid future developments."}

To investigate the effects of RL and thinking in a CXR VLM, we perform large-scale SFT on CXR data to build an updated RadVLM based on Qwen3-VL, followed by a cold-start SFT stage that equips the model with basic thinking ability. We then apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with clinically grounded, task-specific rewards for report generation and visual grounding, and run matched RL experiments on both domain-specific and general-domain Qwen3-VL variants, with and without thinking. Across these settings, we find that while strong SFT remains crucial for high base performance, RL provides additional gains on both tasks, whereas explicit thinking does not appear to further improve results. Under a unified evaluation pipeline, the RL-optimized RadVLM models outperform their baseline counterparts and reach state-of-the-art performance on both report generation and grounding, highlighting clinically aligned RL as a powerful complement to SFT for medical VLMs."}

Existing human-in-the-loop approaches typically assume users begin with a clear, stable concept understanding to be able to provide high-quality supervision. In reality, users often start with a vague idea and must iteratively refine it through \"concept deliberation\", a practice we uncovered through structured interviews with content moderation experts. We operationalize the common strategies in deliberation used by real content moderators into a human-in-the-loop framework called \"Agile Deliberation\" that explicitly supports evolving and subjective concepts. The system supports users in defining the concept for themselves by exposing them to borderline cases. The system does this with two deliberation stages: (1) concept scoping, which decomposes the initial concept into a structured hierarchy of sub-concepts, and (2) concept iteration, which surfaces semantically borderline examples for user reflection and feedback to iteratively align an image classifier with the user's evolving intent. Since concept deliberation is inherently subjective and interactive, we painstakingly evaluate the framework through 18 user sessions, each 1.5h long, rather than standard benchmarking datasets. We find that Agile Deliberation achieves 7.5% higher F1 scores than automated decomposition baselines and more than 3% higher than manual deliberation, while participants reported clearer conceptual understanding and lower cognitive effort."}

We introduce Value-Guided Offline Control Barrier Functions (V-OCBF), a framework that learns a neural CBF entirely from offline demonstrations. Unlike prior approaches, V-OCBF does not assume access to the dynamics model; instead, it derives a recursive finite-difference barrier update, enabling model-free learning of a barrier that propagates safety information over time. Moreover, V-OCBF incorporates an expectile-based objective that avoids querying the barrier on out-of-distribution actions and restricts updates to the dataset-supported action set. The learned barrier is then used with a Quadratic Program (QP) formulation to synthesize real-time safe control. Across multiple case studies, V-OCBF yields substantially fewer safety violations than baseline methods while maintaining strong task performance, highlighting its scalability for offline synthesis of safety-critical controllers without online interaction or hand-engineered barriers."}

In real deployments, providers distribute a global model to many edge devices, where each client personalizes the model using private data. When a deletion request is issued, clients may ignore it or falsely claim compliance, and providers cannot check their parameters or data. This makes verification difficult, especially because personalized models must forget the targeted samples while preserving local utility, and verification must remain lightweight on edge devices.\n  We introduce ZK APEX, a zero-shot personalized unlearning method that operates directly on the personalized model without retraining. ZK APEX combines sparse masking on the provider side with a small Group OBS compensation step on the client side, using a blockwise empirical Fisher matrix to create a curvature-aware update designed for low overhead. Paired with Halo2 zero-knowledge proofs, it enables the provider to verify that the correct unlearning transformation was applied without revealing any private data or personalized parameters.\n  On Vision Transformer classification tasks, ZK APEX recovers nearly all personalization accuracy while effectively removing the targeted information. Applied to the OPT125M generative model trained on code data, it recovers around seventy percent of the original accuracy. Proof generation for the ViT case completes in about two hours, more than ten million times faster than retraining-based checks, with less than one gigabyte of memory use and proof sizes around four hundred megabytes.

Existing approaches, including federated learning (FL) and blockchain-based data markets, fall short: FL often depends on trusted aggregators and lacks Byzantine robustness, while blockchain frameworks struggle with computation-intensive training and incentive integration.\n  We present \\prot, a decentralized data marketplace that unifies federated learning, blockchain arbitration, and economic incentives into a single framework for privacy-preserving data sharing. \\prot\\ enables data buyers to submit bid-based requests via blockchain smart contracts, which manage auctions, escrow, and dispute resolution. Computationally intensive training is delegated to \\cone\\ (\\uline{Co}mpute \\uline{N}etwork for \\uline{E}xecution), an off-chain distributed execution layer. To safeguard against adversarial behavior, \\prot\\ integrates a modified YODA protocol with exponentially growing execution sets for resilient consensus, and introduces Corrected OSMD to mitigate malicious or low-quality contributions from sellers. All protocols are incentive-compatible, and our game-theoretic analysis establishes honesty as the dominant strategy.\n  We implement \\prot\\ on Ethereum and evaluate it over benchmark datasets -- MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 -- under varying adversarial settings. \\prot\\ achieves up to 99\\% accuracy on MNIST and 90\\% on Fashion-MNIST, with less than 3\\% degradation up to 30\\% Byzantine nodes, and 56\\% accuracy on CIFAR-10 despite its complexity. Our results show that \\prot\\ ensures privacy, maintains robustness under adversarial conditions, and scales efficiently with the number of participants, making it a practical foundation for real-world decentralized data sharing."}

In this paper, we introduce, BinSeek, the first two-stage cross-modal retrieval framework for stripped binary code analysis. It consists of two models: BinSeekEmbedding is trained on large-scale dataset to learn the semantic relevance of the binary code and the natural language description, furthermore, BinSeek-Reranker learns to carefully judge the relevance of the candidate code to the description with context augmentation. To this end, we built an LLM-based data synthesis pipeline to automate training construction, also deriving a domain benchmark for future research. Our evaluation results show that BinSeek achieved the state-of-the-art performance, surpassing the the same scale models by 31.42% in Rec@3 and 27.17% in MRR@3, as well as leading the advanced general-purpose models that have 16 times larger parameters."}

But their reliability can be compromised by students who may employ adversarial prompting strategies in order to induce misgrading and secure undeserved academic advantages. In this paper, we present the first large-scale study of jailbreaking LLM-based automated code evaluators in academic context. Our contributions are: (i) We systematically adapt 20+ jailbreaking strategies for jailbreaking AI code evaluators in the academic context, defining a new class of attacks termed academic jailbreaking. (ii) We release a poisoned dataset of 25K adversarial student submissions, specifically designed for the academic code-evaluation setting, sourced from diverse real-world coursework and paired with rubrics and human-graded references, and (iii) In order to capture the multidimensional impact of academic jailbreaking, we systematically adapt and define three jailbreaking metrics (Jailbreak Success Rate, Score Inflation, and Harmfulness). (iv) We comprehensively evalulate the academic jailbreaking attacks using six LLMs. We find that these models exhibit significant vulnerability, particularly to persuasive and role-play-based attacks (up to 97% JSR). Our adversarial dataset and benchmark suite lay the groundwork for next-generation robust LLM-based evaluators in academic code assessment."}

A key requirement for these systems is their ability to accurately follow user instructions. We present Precise Automatically Checked Instruction Following In Code (PACIFIC), a novel framework designed to automatically generate benchmarks that rigorously assess sequential instruction-following and code dry-running capabilities in LLMs, while allowing control over benchmark difficulty. PACIFIC produces benchmark variants with clearly defined expected outputs, enabling straightforward and reliable evaluation through simple output comparisons. In contrast to existing approaches that often rely on tool usage or agentic behavior, our work isolates and evaluates the LLM's intrinsic ability to reason through code behavior step-by-step without execution (dry running) and to follow instructions. Furthermore, our framework mitigates training data contamination by facilitating effortless generation of novel benchmark variations. We validate our framework by generating a suite of benchmarks spanning a range of difficulty levels and evaluating multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results demonstrate that PACIFIC can produce increasingly challenging benchmarks that effectively differentiate instruction-following and dry running capabilities, even among advanced models. Overall, our framework offers a scalable, contamination-resilient methodology for assessing core competencies of LLMs in code-related tasks."}

Unfortunately, recent jailbreaking attacks have shown that adversarial prompts can effectively bypass these mechanisms and induce T2I models to produce sensitive content, revealing critical safety vulnerabilities. However, existing attack methods implicitly assume that the attacker knows the type of deployed defenses, which limits their effectiveness against unknown or diverse defense mechanisms. In this work, we introduce \\textbf{MJA}, a \\textbf{m}etaphor-based \\textbf{j}ailbreaking \\textbf{a}ttack method inspired by the Taboo game, aiming to effectively and efficiently attack diverse defense mechanisms without prior knowledge of their type by generating metaphor-based adversarial prompts. Specifically, MJA consists of two modules: an LLM-based multi-agent generation module~(MLAG) and an adversarial prompt optimization module~(APO). MLAG decomposes the generation of metaphor-based adversarial prompts into three subtasks: metaphor retrieval, context matching, and adversarial prompt generation. Subsequently, MLAG coordinates three LLM-based agents to generate diverse adversarial prompts by exploring various metaphors and contexts. To enhance attack efficiency, APO first trains a surrogate model to predict the attack results of adversarial prompts and then designs an acquisition strategy to adaptively identify optimal adversarial prompts. Extensive experiments on T2I models with various external and internal defense mechanisms demonstrate that MJA outperforms six baseline methods, achieving stronger attack performance while using fewer queries.
