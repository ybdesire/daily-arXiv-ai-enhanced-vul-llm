Abstract: As zero-day Android malware attacks grow more sophisticated, recent research highlights the effectiveness of using image-based representations of malware bytecode to detect previously unseen threats. However, existing studies often overlook how image type and resolution affect detection and ignore valuable textual data in Android Application Packages (APKs), such as permissions and metadata, limiting their ability to fully capture malicious behavior. The integration of multimodality, which combines image and text data, has gained momentum as a promising approach to address these limitations. This paper proposes a multimodal deep learning framework integrating APK images and textual features to enhance Android malware detection. We systematically evaluate various image types and resolutions across different Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) architectures, including VGG, ResNet-152, MobileNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet-B4, and use LLaMA-2, a large language model, to extract and annotate textual features for improved analysis. The findings demonstrate that RGB images at higher resolutions (e.g., 256x256, 512x512) achieve superior classification performance, while the multimodal integration of image and text using the CLIP model reveals limited potential. Overall, this research highlights the importance of systematically evaluating image attributes and integrating multimodal data to develop effective malware detection for Android systems.

Abstract: This work introduces ABE-VVS, a framework that performs attribute based selective coordinate encryption for point cloud based volumetric video streaming, enabling lightweight yet effective digital rights management (DRM). Rather than encrypting entire point cloud frames, our approach encrypts only selected subsets of coordinates ($X, Y, Z$, or combinations), lowering computational overhead and latency while still producing strong visual distortion that prevents meaningful unauthorized viewing. Our experiments show that encrypting only the $X$ coordinates achieves effective obfuscation while reducing encryption and decryption times by up to 50% and 80%, respectively, compared to full-frame encryption.
  To our knowledge, this is the first work to provide a novel end-to-end evaluation of a DRM-enabled secure point cloud streaming system. We deployed a point cloud video streaming setup on the CloudLab testbed and evaluated three HTTP-based Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) granularities - ABE-XYZ (encrypting all $X,Y,Z$ coordinates), ABE-XY, and ABE-X against conventional HTTPS/TLS secure streaming as well as an HTTP-only baseline without any security. Our streaming evaluation demonstrates that ABE-based schemes reduce server-side CPU load by up to 80% and cache CPU load by up to 63%, comparable to HTTP-only, while maintaining similar cache hit rates. Moreover, ABE-XYZ and ABE-XY exhibit lower client-side rebuffering than HTTPS, and ABE-X achieves zero rebuffering comparable to HTTP-only. Although ABE-VVS increases client-side CPU usage, the overhead is not large enough to affect streaming quality and is offset by its broader benefits, including simplified key revocation, elimination of per-client encryption, and reduced server and cache load.

Abstract: Enterprise security faces escalating threats from sophisticated malware, compounded by expanding digital operations. This paper presents the first systematic evaluation of large language models (LLMs) to proactively identify indicators of compromise (IOCs) from unstructured web-based threat intelligence sources, distinguishing it from reactive malware detection approaches. We developed an automated system that pulls IOCs from 15 web-based threat report sources to evaluate six LLM models (Gemini, Qwen, and Llama variants). Our evaluation of 479 webpages containing 2,658 IOCs (711 IPv4 addresses, 502 IPv6 addresses, 1,445 domains) reveals significant performance variations. Gemini 1.5 Pro achieved 0.958 precision and 0.788 specificity for malicious IOC identification, while demonstrating perfect recall (1.0) for actual threats.

Abstract: The parallel evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) with advanced code-understanding capabilities and the increasing sophistication of malware presents a new frontier for cybersecurity research. This paper evaluates the efficacy of state-of-the-art LLMs in classifying executable code as either benign or malicious. We introduce an automated pipeline that first decompiles Windows executable into a C code using Ghidra disassembler and then leverages LLMs to perform the classification. Our evaluation reveals that while standard LLMs show promise, they are not yet robust enough to replace traditional anti-virus software. We demonstrate that a fine-tuned model, trained on curated malware and benign datasets, significantly outperforms its vanilla counterpart. However, the performance of even this specialized model degrades notably when encountering newer malware. This finding demonstrates the critical need for continuous fine-tuning with emerging threats to maintain model effectiveness against the changing coding patterns and behaviors of malicious software.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Stylometry--the identification of an author through analysis of a text's style (i.e., authorship attribution)--serves many constructive purposes: it supports copyright and plagiarism investigations, aids detection of harmful content, offers exploratory cues for certain medical conditions (e.g., early signs of dementia or depression), provides historical context for literary works, and helps uncover misinformation and disinformation. In contrast, when stylometry is employed as a tool for authorship verification--confirming whether a text truly originates from a claimed author--it can also be weaponized for malicious purposes. Techniques such as de-anonymization, re-identification, tracking, profiling, and downstream effects like censorship illustrate the privacy threats that stylometric analysis can enable. Building on these concerns, this paper further explores how adversarial stylometry combined with steganography can counteract stylometric analysis. We first present enhancements to our adversarial attack, $\textit{TraceTarnish}$, providing stronger evidence of its capacity to confound stylometric systems and reduce their attribution and verification accuracy. Next, we examine how steganographic embedding can be fine-tuned to mask an author's stylistic fingerprint, quantifying the level of authorship obfuscation achievable as a function of the proportion of words altered with zero-width Unicode characters. Based on our findings, steganographic coverage of 33% or higher seemingly ensures authorship obfuscation. Finally, we reflect on the ways stylometry can be used to undermine privacy and argue for the necessity of defensive tools like $\textit{TraceTarnish}$.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: A proof of the security of the Bitcoin protocol is made rigorous, and simplified in certain parts. A computational model in which an adversary can delay transmission of blocks by time $Δ$ is considered. The protocol is generalized to allow blocks of different scores and a proof within this more general model is presented. An approach used in a previous paper that used random walk theory is shown through a counterexample to be incorrect; an approach involving a punctured block arrival process is shown to remedy this error. Thus, it is proven that with probability one, the Bitcoin protocol will have infinitely many honest blocks so long as the fully-delayed honest mining rate exceeds the adversary mining rate.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Proof of work blockchain protocols using multiple hash types are considered. It is proven that the security region of such a protocol cannot be the AND of a 51\% attack on all the hash types. Nevertheless, a protocol called Merged Bitcoin is introduced, which is the Bitcoin protocol where links between blocks can be formed using multiple different hash types. Closed form bounds on its security region in the $Δ$-bounded delay network model are proven, and these bounds are compared to simulation results. This protocol is proven to maximize cost of attack in the linear cost-per-hash model. A difficulty adjustment method is introduced, and it is argued that this can partly remedy asymmetric advantages an adversary may gain in hashing power for some hash types, including from algorithmic advances, quantum attacks like Grover's algorithm, or hardware backdoor attacks.

Abstract: Capture-the-Flag (CTF) competitions play a central role in modern cybersecurity as a platform for training practitioners and evaluating offensive and defensive techniques derived from real-world vulnerabilities. Despite recent advances in large language models (LLMs), existing LLM-based agents remain ineffective on high-difficulty cryptographic CTF challenges, which require precise cryptanalytic knowledge, stable long-horizon reasoning, and disciplined interaction with specialized toolchains. Through a systematic exploratory study, we show that insufficient knowledge granularity, rather than model reasoning capacity, is a primary factor limiting successful cryptographic exploitation: coarse or abstracted external knowledge often fails to support correct attack modeling and implementation. Motivated by this observation, we propose KryptoPilot, an open-world knowledge-augmented LLM agent for automated cryptographic exploitation. KryptoPilot integrates dynamic open-world knowledge acquisition via a Deep Research pipeline, a persistent workspace for structured knowledge reuse, and a governance subsystem that stabilizes reasoning through behavioral constraints and cost-aware model routing. This design enables precise knowledge alignment while maintaining efficient reasoning across heterogeneous subtasks. We evaluate KryptoPilot on two established CTF benchmarks and in six real-world CTF competitions. KryptoPilot achieves a complete solve rate on InterCode-CTF, solves between 56 and 60 percent of cryptographic challenges on the NYU-CTF benchmark, and successfully solves 26 out of 33 cryptographic challenges in live competitions, including multiple earliest-solved and uniquely-solved instances. These results demonstrate the necessity of open-world, fine-grained knowledge augmentation and governed reasoning for scaling LLM-based agents to real-world cryptographic exploitation.

Abstract: While much of the current research in deep learning-based vulnerability detection relies on disassembled binaries, this paper explores the feasibility of extracting features directly from raw x86-64 machine code. Although assembly language is more interpretable for humans, it requires more complex models to capture token-level context. In contrast, machine code may enable more efficient, lightweight models and preserve all information that might be lost in disassembly. This paper approaches the task of vulnerability detection through an exploratory study on two specific deep learning model architectures and aims to systematically evaluate their performance across three vulnerability types. The results demonstrate that graph-based models consistently outperform sequential models, emphasizing the importance of control flow relationships, and that machine code contains sufficient information for effective vulnerability discovery.

Abstract: Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) are gaining popularity as an effective means to provide confidentiality in the cloud. TEEs, such as Intel SGX, suffer from so-called rollback and cloning attacks (often referred to as forking attacks). Rollback attacks are enabled by the lack of freshness guarantees for sealed data; cloning attacks stem from the inability to determine if other instances of an enclave are running on the same platform. While rollback attacks have been extensively studied by the community, cloning attacks have been, unfortunately, less investigated. To address this gap, we extensively study and thoroughly analyze the susceptibility of 72 SGX-based proposals to cloning attacks. Our results show that roughly 20% of the analyzed proposals are insecure against cloning attacks-including those applications that rely on monotonic counters and are, therefore, secure against rollback attacks.

Abstract: The IEC 61850 Generic Object-Oriented Substation Event (GOOSE) protocol plays a critical role in real-time protection and automation of digital substations, yet its lack of native security mechanisms can expose power systems to sophisticated cyberattacks. Traditional rule-based and supervised intrusion detection techniques struggle to detect protocol-compliant and zero-day attacks under significant class imbalance and limited availability of labeled data. This paper proposes an explainable, unsupervised multi-view anomaly detection framework for IEC 61850 GOOSE networks that explicitly separates semantic integrity and temporal availability. The approach employs asymmetric autoencoders trained only on real operational GOOSE traffic to learn distinct latent representations of sequence-based protocol semantics and timing-related transmission dynamics in normal traffic. Anomaly detection is implemented using reconstruction errors mixed with statistically grounded thresholds, enabling robust detection without specified attack types. Feature-level reconstruction analysis provides intrinsic explainability by directly linking detection outcomes to IEC 61850 protocol characteristics. The proposed framework is evaluated using real substation traffic for training and a public dataset containing normal traffic and message suppression, data manipulation, and denial-of-service attacks for testing. Experimental results show attack detection rates above 99% with false positives remaining below 5% of total traffic, demonstrating strong generalization across environments and effective operation under extreme class imbalance and interpretable anomaly attribution.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have powerful capabilities, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which is a critical barrier to their safe web real-time application. Current commercial LLM providers deploy output guardrails to filter harmful outputs, yet these defenses are not impenetrable. Due to LLMs' reliance on autoregressive, token-by-token inference, their semantic representations lack robustness to spatially structured perturbations, such as redistributing tokens across different rows, columns, or diagonals. Exploiting the Transformer's spatial weakness, we propose SpatialJB to disrupt the model's output generation process, allowing harmful content to bypass guardrails without detection. Comprehensive experiments conducted on leading LLMs get nearly 100% ASR, demonstrating the high effectiveness of SpatialJB. Even after adding advanced output guardrails, like the OpenAI Moderation API, SpatialJB consistently maintains a success rate exceeding 75%, outperforming current jailbreak techniques by a significant margin. The proposal of SpatialJB exposes a key weakness in current guardrails and emphasizes the importance of spatial semantics, offering new insights to advance LLM safety research. To prevent potential misuse, we also present baseline defense strategies against SpatialJB and evaluate their effectiveness in mitigating such attacks. The code for the attack, baseline defenses, and a demo are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SpatialJailbreak-8E63.

Abstract: We present CallShield, the first caller identity authentication system that operates entirely at the audio layer, without relying on speech transcription, internet connectivity, or trusted infrastructure. CallShield introduces a real-time neural watermarking technique that enables per-bit embedding and recovery within 40-millisecond frames of live 8 kHz speech. This capability allows CallShield to transform the real-time audio channel into a noisy serial communication medium. To ensure reliable data transmission, CallShield implements a low-bitrate data link protocol that provides basic frame synchronization along with error detection, correction, and recovery. For caller authentication, CallShield adopts a secure and lightweight symmetric-key protocol that relies on pairwise shared secrets among trusted contacts. The system completes the full authentication process in an average of 63 seconds, including up to three retransmission attempts, making it suitable for real-time deployment. Extensive experiments under realistic telephony conditions demonstrate that CallShield achieves an overall authentication success rates exceeding 99.2% on clean audio and over 95% under common distortions, aided by selective retransmission of failed messages. Additionally, CallShield maintains high audio quality, achieving PESQ scores above 4.2 and STOI scores above 0.94 on clean speech, and exhibits robustness across a wide range of channel distortions, validating its practical viability for secure, real-time caller authentication.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Traceability systems have become prevalent in supply chains because of the rapid development of RFID and IoT technologies. These systems facilitate product recall and mitigate problems such as counterfeiting, tampering, and theft by tracking the manufacturing and distribution life-cycle of a product. Therefore, traceability systems are a defense mechanism against supply chain attacks and, consequently, have become a target for attackers to circumvent. For example, a counterfeiter may change the trace of a fake product for the trace of an authentic product, fooling the system into accepting a counterfeit product as legit and thereby giving a false sense of security.
  This systematic analysis starts with the observation that security requirements in existing traceability solutions are often unstructured or incomplete, leaving critical vulnerabilities unaddressed. We synthesized the properties of current state-of-the-art traceability solutions within a single security framework that allows us to analyze and compare their security claims. Using this framework, we objectively compared the security of $17$ traceability solutions and identified several weaknesses and vulnerabilities. This article reports on these flaws, the methodology we used to identify them, and the first security evaluation of traceability solutions on a large scale.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In collaborative learning (CL), multiple parties jointly train a machine learning model on their private datasets. However, data can not be shared directly due to privacy concerns. To ensure input confidentiality, cryptographic techniques, e.g., multi-party computation (MPC), enable training on encrypted data. Yet, even securely trained models are vulnerable to inference attacks aiming to extract memorized data from model outputs. To ensure output privacy and mitigate inference attacks, differential privacy (DP) injects calibrated noise during training. While cryptography and DP offer complementary guarantees, combining them efficiently for cryptographic and differentially private CL (CPCL) is challenging. Cryptography incurs performance overheads, while DP degrades accuracy, creating a privacy-accuracy-performance trade-off that needs careful design considerations. This work systematizes the CPCL landscape. We introduce a unified framework that generalizes common phases across CPCL paradigms, and identify secure noise sampling as the foundational phase to achieve CPCL. We analyze trade-offs of different secure noise sampling techniques, noise types, and DP mechanisms discussing their implementation challenges and evaluating their accuracy and cryptographic overhead across CPCL paradigms. Additionally, we implement identified secure noise sampling options in MPC and evaluate their computation and communication costs in WAN and LAN. Finally, we propose future research directions based on identified key observations, gaps and possible enhancements in the literature.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language model (LLM)-based systems -- from chatbots to autonomous agents capable of executing code and financial transactions -- has created a new attack surface that existing security frameworks inadequately address. The dominant framing of these threats as "prompt injection" -- a catch-all phrase for security failures in LLM-based systems -- obscures a more complex reality: Attacks on LLM-based systems increasingly involve multi-step sequences that mirror traditional malware campaigns. In this paper, we propose that attacks targeting LLM-based applications constitute a distinct class of malware, which we term \textit{promptware}, and introduce a five-step kill chain model for analyzing these threats. The framework comprises Initial Access (prompt injection), Privilege Escalation (jailbreaking), Persistence (memory and retrieval poisoning), Lateral Movement (cross-system and cross-user propagation), and Actions on Objective (ranging from data exfiltration to unauthorized transactions). By mapping recent attacks to this structure, we demonstrate that LLM-related attacks follow systematic sequences analogous to traditional malware campaigns. The promptware kill chain offers security practitioners a structured methodology for threat modeling and provides a common vocabulary for researchers across AI safety and cybersecurity to address a rapidly evolving threat landscape.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present the Physics-Informed Optimal Homotopy Analysis Method (PI-OHAM) for solving nonlinear differential equations. PI-OHAM, based on classical HAM, employs a physics-informed residual loss to optimize convergence-control parameters systematically by combining data, boundary conditions, and governing equations in the manner similar to Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). The combination of the flexibility of PINNs and the analytical transparency of HAM provides the approach with high numerical stability, rapid convergence, and high consistency with traditional numerical solutions. PI-OHAM has superior accuracy-time trade-offs and faster and more accurate convergence than standard HAM and PINNs when applied to the Blasius boundary-layer problem. It is also very close to numerical standards available in the literature. PI-OHAM ensures analytical transparency and interpretability by series-based solutions, unlike purely data-driven or data-free PINNs. Significant contributions are a conceptual bridge between decades of homotopy-based analysis and modern physics-inspired methods, and a numerically aided but analytically interpretable solver of nonlinear differential equations. PI-OHAM appears as a computationally efficient, accurate and understandable alternative to nonlinear fluid flow, heat transfer and other industrial problems in cases where robustness and interpretability are important.

Abstract: In educational applications, LLMs exhibit several fundamental pedagogical limitations, such as their tendency to reveal solutions rather than support dialogic learning. We introduce ConvoLearn (https://huggingface.co/datasets/masharma/convolearn ), a dataset grounded in knowledge building theory that operationalizes six core pedagogical dimensions: cognitive engagement, formative assessment, accountability, cultural responsiveness, metacognition, and power dynamics. We construct a semi-synthetic dataset of 1250 tutor-student dialogues (20 turns each) in middle school Earth Science through controlled interactions between human teachers and a simulated student. Using QLoRA, we demonstrate that training on this dataset meaningfully shifts LLM behavior toward knowledge-building strategies. Human evaluation by 31 teachers shows our fine-tuned Mistral 7B (M = 4.10, SD = 1.03) significantly outperforms both its base version (M = 2.59, SD = 1.11) and Claude Sonnet 4.5 (M = 2.87, SD = 1.29) overall. This work establishes a potential framework to guide future development and evaluation of constructivist AI tutors.

Abstract: Reliable clinical decision support requires medical AI agents capable of safe, multi-step reasoning over structured electronic health records (EHRs). While large language models (LLMs) show promise in healthcare, existing benchmarks inadequately assess performance on action-based tasks involving threshold evaluation, temporal aggregation, and conditional logic. We introduce ART, an Action-based Reasoning clinical Task benchmark for medical AI agents, which mines real-world EHR data to create challenging tasks targeting known reasoning weaknesses. Through analysis of existing benchmarks, we identify three dominant error categories: retrieval failures, aggregation errors, and conditional logic misjudgments. Our four-stage pipeline -- scenario identification, task generation, quality audit, and evaluation -- produces diverse, clinically validated tasks grounded in real patient data. Evaluating GPT-4o-mini and Claude 3.5 Sonnet on 600 tasks shows near-perfect retrieval after prompt refinement, but substantial gaps in aggregation (28--64%) and threshold reasoning (32--38%). By exposing failure modes in action-oriented EHR reasoning, ART advances toward more reliable clinical agents, an essential step for AI systems that reduce cognitive load and administrative burden, supporting workforce capacity in high-demand care settings

Abstract: The advancement of large language model (LLM) based agents has shifted AI evaluation from single-turn response assessment to multi-step task completion in interactive environments. We present an empirical study evaluating frontier AI models on 150 workplace tasks within a realistic e-commerce RL environment from Surge. Our analysis reveals an empirically-derived \emph{hierarchy of agentic capabilities} that models must master for real-world deployment: (1) tool use, (2) planning and goal formation, (3) adaptability, (4) groundedness, and (5) common-sense reasoning. Even the best-performing models fail approximately 40\% of the tasks, with failures clustering predictably along this hierarchy. Weaker models struggle with fundamental tool use and planning, whereas stronger models primarily fail on tasks requiring contextual inference beyond explicit instructions. We introduce a task-centric design methodology for RL environments that emphasizes diversity and domain expert contributions, provide detailed failure analysis, and discuss implications for agent development. Our findings suggest that while current frontier models can demonstrate coherent multi-step behavior, substantial capability gaps remain before achieving human-level task completion in realistic workplace settings.

Abstract: Developing safe, effective, and practically useful clinical prediction models (CPMs) traditionally requires iterative collaboration between clinical experts, data scientists, and informaticists. This process refines the often small but critical details of the model building process, such as which features/patients to include and how clinical categories should be defined. However, this traditional collaboration process is extremely time- and resource-intensive, resulting in only a small fraction of CPMs reaching clinical practice. This challenge intensifies when teams attempt to incorporate unstructured clinical notes, which can contain an enormous number of concepts. To address this challenge, we introduce HACHI, an iterative human-in-the-loop framework that uses AI agents to accelerate the development of fully interpretable CPMs by enabling the exploration of concepts in clinical notes. HACHI alternates between (i) an AI agent rapidly exploring and evaluating candidate concepts in clinical notes and (ii) clinical and domain experts providing feedback to improve the CPM learning process. HACHI defines concepts as simple yes-no questions that are used in linear models, allowing the clinical AI team to transparently review, refine, and validate the CPM learned in each round. In two real-world prediction tasks (acute kidney injury and traumatic brain injury), HACHI outperforms existing approaches, surfaces new clinically relevant concepts not included in commonly-used CPMs, and improves model generalizability across clinical sites and time periods. Furthermore, HACHI reveals the critical role of the clinical AI team, such as directing the AI agent to explore concepts that it had not previously considered, adjusting the granularity of concepts it considers, changing the objective function to better align with the clinical objectives, and identifying issues of data bias and leakage.

Abstract: Multi-constraint planning involves identifying, evaluating, and refining candidate plans while satisfying multiple, potentially conflicting constraints. Existing large language model (LLM) approaches face fundamental limitations in this domain. Pure reasoning paradigms, which rely on long natural language chains, are prone to inconsistency, error accumulation, and prohibitive cost as constraints compound. Conversely, LLMs combined with coding- or solver-based strategies lack flexibility: they often generate problem-specific code from scratch or depend on fixed solvers, failing to capture generalizable logic across diverse problems. To address these challenges, we introduce the Scalable COde Planning Engine (SCOPE), a framework that disentangles query-specific reasoning from generic code execution. By separating reasoning from execution, SCOPE produces solver functions that are consistent, deterministic, and reusable across queries while requiring only minimal changes to input parameters. SCOPE achieves state-of-the-art performance while lowering cost and latency. For example, with GPT-4o, it reaches 93.1% success on TravelPlanner, a 61.6% gain over the best baseline (CoT) while cutting inference cost by 1.4x and time by ~4.67x. Code is available at https://github.com/DerrickGXD/SCOPE.

Abstract: Production scheduling is highly susceptible to dynamic disruptions, such as variations in processing times, machine availability, and unexpected task insertions. Conventional approaches typically rely on event-specific models and explicit analytical formulations, which limits their adaptability and generalization across previously unseen disturbances. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes DScheLLM, a dynamic scheduling approach that leverages fine-tuned large language models within a dual-system (fast-slow) reasoning architecture to address disturbances of different scales. A unified large language model-based framework is constructed to handle dynamic events, where training datasets for both fast and slow reasoning modes are generated using exact schedules obtained from an operations research solver. The Huawei OpenPangu Embedded-7B model is subsequently fine-tuned under the hybrid reasoning paradigms using LoRA. Experimental evaluations on standard job shop scheduling benchmarks demonstrate that the fast-thinking mode can efficiently generate high-quality schedules and the slow-thinking mode can produce solver-compatible and well-formatted decision inputs. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents one of the earliest studies applying large language models to job shop scheduling in dynamic environments, highlighting their considerable potential for intelligent and adaptive scheduling optimization.

Abstract: Civil aviation is a cornerstone of global transportation and commerce, and ensuring its safety, efficiency and customer satisfaction is paramount. Yet conventional Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions in aviation remain siloed and narrow, focusing on isolated tasks or single modalities. They struggle to integrate heterogeneous data such as voice communications, radar tracks, sensor streams and textual reports, which limits situational awareness, adaptability, and real-time decision support. This paper introduces the vision of AviationLMM, a Large Multimodal foundation Model for civil aviation, designed to unify the heterogeneous data streams of civil aviation and enable understanding, reasoning, generation and agentic applications. We firstly identify the gaps between existing AI solutions and requirements. Secondly, we describe the model architecture that ingests multimodal inputs such as air-ground voice, surveillance, on-board telemetry, video and structured texts, and performs cross-modal alignment and fusion, and produces flexible outputs ranging from situation summaries and risk alerts to predictive diagnostics and multimodal incident reconstructions. In order to fully realize this vision, we identify key research opportunities to address, including data acquisition, alignment and fusion, pretraining, reasoning, trustworthiness, privacy, robustness to missing modalities, and synthetic scenario generation. By articulating the design and challenges of AviationLMM, we aim to boost the civil aviation foundation model progress and catalyze coordinated research efforts toward an integrated, trustworthy and privacy-preserving aviation AI ecosystem.

Abstract: Memory plays a foundational role in augmenting the reasoning, adaptability, and contextual fidelity of modern Large Language Models and Multi-Modal LLMs. As these models transition from static predictors to interactive systems capable of continual learning and personalized inference, the incorporation of memory mechanisms has emerged as a central theme in their architectural and functional evolution. This survey presents a comprehensive and structured synthesis of memory in LLMs and MLLMs, organizing the literature into a cohesive taxonomy comprising implicit, explicit, and agentic memory paradigms. Specifically, the survey delineates three primary memory frameworks. Implicit memory refers to the knowledge embedded within the internal parameters of pre-trained transformers, encompassing their capacity for memorization, associative retrieval, and contextual reasoning. Recent work has explored methods to interpret, manipulate, and reconfigure this latent memory. Explicit memory involves external storage and retrieval components designed to augment model outputs with dynamic, queryable knowledge representations, such as textual corpora, dense vectors, and graph-based structures, thereby enabling scalable and updatable interaction with information sources. Agentic memory introduces persistent, temporally extended memory structures within autonomous agents, facilitating long-term planning, self-consistency, and collaborative behavior in multi-agent systems, with relevance to embodied and interactive AI. Extending beyond text, the survey examines the integration of memory within multi-modal settings, where coherence across vision, language, audio, and action modalities is essential. Key architectural advances, benchmark tasks, and open challenges are discussed, including issues related to memory capacity, alignment, factual consistency, and cross-system interoperability.

Abstract: This paper introduces PRA, an AI-agent design for simulating how individual users form privacy concerns in response to real-world news. Moving beyond population-level sentiment analysis, PRA integrates privacy and cognitive theories to simulate user-specific privacy reasoning grounded in personal comment histories and contextual cues. The agent reconstructs each user's "privacy mind", dynamically activates relevant privacy memory through a contextual filter that emulates bounded rationality, and generates synthetic comments reflecting how that user would likely respond to new privacy scenarios. A complementary LLM-as-a-Judge evaluator, calibrated against an established privacy concern taxonomy, quantifies the faithfulness of generated reasoning. Experiments on real-world Hacker News discussions show that \PRA outperforms baseline agents in privacy concern prediction and captures transferable reasoning patterns across domains including AI, e-commerce, and healthcare.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of AI research has intensified the Reviewer Gap, threatening the peer-review sustainability and perpetuating a cycle of low-quality evaluations. This position paper critiques existing LLM approaches that automatically generate reviews and argues for a paradigm shift that positions LLMs as tools for assisting and educating human reviewers. We define the core principles of high-quality peer review and propose two complementary systems grounded in these foundations: (i) an LLM-assisted mentoring system that cultivates reviewers' long-term competencies, and (ii) an LLM-assisted feedback system that helps reviewers refine the quality of their reviews. This human-centered approach aims to strengthen reviewer expertise and contribute to building a more sustainable scholarly ecosystem.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) Agents exhibit inherent reasoning abilities through the collaboration of multiple tools. However, during agent inference, existing methods often suffer from (i) locally myopic generation, due to the absence of lookahead, and (ii) trajectory instability, where minor early errors can escalate into divergent reasoning paths. These issues make it difficult to balance global effectiveness and computational efficiency. To address these two issues, we propose meta-adaptive exploration with LLM agents https://github.com/exoskeletonzj/MAXS, a meta-adaptive reasoning framework based on LLM Agents that flexibly integrates tool execution and reasoning planning. MAXS employs a lookahead strategy to extend reasoning paths a few steps ahead, estimating the advantage value of tool usage, and combines step consistency variance and inter-step trend slopes to jointly select stable, consistent, and high-value reasoning steps. Additionally, we introduce a trajectory convergence mechanism that controls computational cost by halting further rollouts once path consistency is achieved, enabling a balance between resource efficiency and global effectiveness in multi-tool reasoning. We conduct extensive empirical studies across three base models (MiMo-VL-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-32B) and five datasets, demonstrating that MAXS consistently outperforms existing methods in both performance and inference efficiency. Further analysis confirms the effectiveness of our lookahead strategy and tool usage.

Abstract: High-quality chain-of-thought has demonstrated strong potential for unlocking the reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, current paradigms typically treat the reasoning process as an indivisible sequence, lacking an intrinsic mechanism to quantify step-wise information gain. This granularity gap manifests in two limitations: inference inefficiency from redundant exploration without explicit guidance, and optimization difficulty due to sparse outcome supervision or costly external verifiers. In this work, we propose CoT-Flow, a framework that reconceptualizes discrete reasoning steps as a continuous probabilistic flow, quantifying the contribution of each step toward the ground-truth answer. Built on this formulation, CoT-Flow enables two complementary methodologies: flow-guided decoding, which employs a greedy flow-based decoding strategy to extract information-efficient reasoning paths, and flow-based reinforcement learning, which constructs a verifier-free dense reward function. Experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that CoT-Flow achieves a superior balance between inference efficiency and reasoning performance.

Abstract: Effective pandemic control requires timely and coordinated policymaking across administrative regions that are intrinsically interdependent. However, human-driven responses are often fragmented and reactive, with policies formulated in isolation and adjusted only after outbreaks escalate, undermining proactive intervention and global pandemic mitigation. To address this challenge, here we propose a large language model (LLM) multi-agent policymaking framework that supports coordinated and proactive pandemic control across regions. Within our framework, each administrative region is assigned an LLM agent as an AI policymaking assistant. The agent reasons over region-specific epidemiological dynamics while communicating with other agents to account for cross-regional interdependencies. By integrating real-world data, a pandemic evolution simulator, and structured inter-agent communication, our framework enables agents to jointly explore counterfactual intervention scenarios and synthesize coordinated policy decisions through a closed-loop simulation process. We validate the proposed framework using state-level COVID-19 data from the United States between April and December 2020, together with real-world mobility records and observed policy interventions. Compared with real-world pandemic outcomes, our approach reduces cumulative infections and deaths by up to 63.7% and 40.1%, respectively, at the individual state level, and by 39.0% and 27.0%, respectively, when aggregated across states. These results demonstrate that LLM multi-agent systems can enable more effective pandemic control with coordinated policymaking...

Abstract: Recent work on domain-specific reasoning with large language models (LLMs) often relies on training-intensive approaches that require parameter updates. While activation steering has emerged as a parameter efficient alternative, existing methods apply static, manual interventions that fail to adapt to the dynamic nature of complex reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose RISER (Router-based Intervention for Steerable Enhancement of Reasoning), a plug-and-play intervention framework that adaptively steers LLM reasoning in activation space. RISER constructs a library of reusable reasoning vectors and employs a lightweight Router to dynamically compose them for each input. The Router is optimized via reinforcement learning under task-level rewards, activating latent cognitive primitives in an emergent and compositional manner. Across seven diverse benchmarks, RISER yields 3.4-6.5% average zero-shot accuracy improvements over the base model while surpassing CoT-style reasoning with 2-3x higher token efficiency and robust accuracy gains. Further analysis shows that RISER autonomously combines multiple vectors into interpretable, precise control strategies, pointing toward more controllable and efficient LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Scientific reasoning relies not only on logical inference but also on activating prior knowledge and experiential structures. Memory can efficiently reuse knowledge and enhance reasoning consistency and stability. However, existing benchmarks mainly evaluate final answers or step-by-step coherence, overlooking the \textit{memory-driven} mechanisms that underlie human reasoning, which involves activating anchors and attractors, then integrating them into multi-step inference. To address this gap, we propose $A^3$-Bench~ https://a3-bench.github.io, a benchmark designed to evaluate scientific reasoning through dual-scale memory-driven activation, grounded in Anchor and Attractor Activation. First, we annotate 2,198 science reasoning problems across domains using the SAPM process(subject, anchor & attractor, problem, and memory developing). Second, we introduce a dual-scale memory evaluation framework utilizing anchors and attractors, along with the AAUI(Anchor--Attractor Utilization Index) metric to measure memory activation rates. Finally, through experiments with various base models and paradigms, we validate $A^3$-Bench and analyze how memory activation impacts reasoning performance, providing insights into memory-driven scientific reasoning.

Abstract: Recent advances in DeepResearch-style agents have demonstrated strong capabilities in autonomous information acquisition and synthesize from real-world web environments. However, existing approaches remain fundamentally limited to text modality. Extending autonomous information-seeking agents to multimodal settings introduces critical challenges: the specialization-generalization trade-off that emerges when training models for multimodal tool-use at scale, and the severe scarcity of training data capturing complex, multi-step multimodal search trajectories. To address these challenges, we propose M$^3$Searcher, a modular multimodal information-seeking agent that explicitly decouples information acquisition from answer derivation. M$^3$Searcher is optimized with a retrieval-oriented multi-objective reward that jointly encourages factual accuracy, reasoning soundness, and retrieval fidelity. In addition, we develop MMSearchVQA, a multimodal multi-hop dataset to support retrieval centric RL training. Experimental results demonstrate that M$^3$Searcher outperforms existing approaches, exhibits strong transfer adaptability and effective reasoning in complex multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have advanced automated multi-step reasoning, but their ability to generate complex Chain-of-Thought (CoT) trajectories introduces severe privacy risks, as sensitive information may be deeply embedded throughout the reasoning process. Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) unlearning approaches that typically focus on modifying only final answers are insufficient for LRMs, as they fail to remove sensitive content from intermediate steps, leading to persistent privacy leakage and degraded security. To address these challenges, we propose Sensitive Trajectory Regulation (STaR), a parameter-free, inference-time unlearning framework that achieves robust privacy protection throughout the reasoning process. Specifically, we first identify sensitive content via semantic-aware detection. Then, we inject global safety constraints through secure prompt prefix. Next, we perform trajectory-aware suppression to dynamically block sensitive content across the entire reasoning chain. Finally, we apply token-level adaptive filtering to prevent both exact and paraphrased sensitive tokens during generation. Furthermore, to overcome the inadequacies of existing evaluation protocols, we introduce two metrics: Multi-Decoding Consistency Assessment (MCS), which measures the consistency of unlearning across diverse decoding strategies, and Multi-Granularity Membership Inference Attack (MIA) Evaluation, which quantifies privacy protection at both answer and reasoning-chain levels. Experiments on the R-TOFU benchmark demonstrate that STaR achieves comprehensive and stable unlearning with minimal utility loss, setting a new standard for privacy-preserving reasoning in LRMs.

Abstract: Cluster workload allocation often requires complex configurations, creating a usability gap. This paper introduces a semantic, intent-driven scheduling paradigm for cluster systems using Natural Language Processing. The system employs a Large Language Model (LLM) integrated via a Kubernetes scheduler extender to interpret natural language allocation hint annotations for soft affinity preferences. A prototype featuring a cluster state cache and an intent analyzer (using AWS Bedrock) was developed. Empirical evaluation demonstrated high LLM parsing accuracy (>95% Subset Accuracy on an evaluation ground-truth dataset) for top-tier models like Amazon Nova Pro/Premier and Mistral Pixtral Large, significantly outperforming a baseline engine. Scheduling quality tests across six scenarios showed the prototype achieved superior or equivalent placement compared to standard Kubernetes configurations, particularly excelling in complex and quantitative scenarios and handling conflicting soft preferences. The results validate using LLMs for accessible scheduling but highlight limitations like synchronous LLM latency, suggesting asynchronous processing for production readiness. This work confirms the viability of semantic soft affinity for simplifying workload orchestration.

Abstract: Lane-free traffic environments allow vehicles to better harness the lateral capacity of the road without being restricted to lane-keeping, thereby increasing the traffic flow rates. As such, we have a distinct and more challenging setting for autonomous driving. In this work, we consider a Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planning approach for single-agent autonomous driving in lane-free traffic, where the associated Markov Decision Process we formulate is influenced from existing approaches tied to reinforcement learning frameworks. In addition, MCTS is equipped with a pre-trained neural network (NN) that guides the selection phase. This procedure incorporates the predictive capabilities of NNs for a more informed tree search process under computational constraints. In our experimental evaluation, we consider metrics that address both safety (through collision rates) and efficacy (through measured speed). Then, we examine: (a) the influence of isotropic state information for vehicles in a lane-free environment, resulting in nudging behaviour--vehicles' policy reacts due to the presence of faster tailing ones, (b) the acceleration of performance for the NN-guided variant of MCTS, and (c) the trade-off between computational resources and solution quality.

Abstract: Current large language model agents predominantly operate under a reactive paradigm, responding only to immediate user queries within short-term sessions. This limitation hinders their ability to maintain long-term user's intents and dynamically adapt to evolving external environments. In this paper, we propose a novel interaction paradigm for proactive Task-oriented Agents capable of bridging the gap between relatively static user's needs and a dynamic environment. We formalize proactivity through two key capabilities, (i) Intent-Conditioned Monitoring: The agent autonomously formulates trigger conditions based on dialog history; (ii) Event-Triggered Follow-up: The agent actively engages the user upon detecting useful environmental updates. We introduce a high-quality data synthesis pipeline to construct complex, multi-turn dialog data in a dynamic environment. Furthermore, we attempt to address the lack of evaluation criteria of task-oriented interaction in a dynamic environment by proposing a new benchmark, namely ChronosBench. We evaluated some leading close-source and open-source models at present and revealed their flaws in long-term task-oriented interaction. Furthermore, our fine-tuned model trained using synthetic data for supervised learning achieves a task completion rate of 85.19% for complex tasks including shifts in user intent, outperforming other models under test. And the result validated the effectiveness of our data-driven strategy.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex decision-making and tool-use tasks, yet their ability to generalize across varying environments remains a under-examined concern. Current evaluation paradigms predominantly rely on trajectory-based metrics that measure task success, while failing to assess whether agents possess a grounded, transferable model of the environment. To address this gap, we propose Task-to-Quiz (T2Q), a deterministic and automated evaluation paradigm designed to decouple task execution from world-state understanding. We instantiate this paradigm in T2QBench, a suite comprising 30 environments and 1,967 grounded QA pairs across multiple difficulty levels. Our extensive experiments reveal that task success is often a poor proxy for environment understanding, and that current memory machanism can not effectively help agents acquire a grounded model of the environment. These findings identify proactive exploration and fine-grained state representation as primary bottlenecks, offering a robust foundation for developing more generalizable autonomous agents.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are making significant progress in multimodal reasoning. Early approaches focus on pure text-based reasoning. More recent studies have incorporated multimodal information into the reasoning steps; however, they often follow a single task-specific reasoning pattern, which limits their generalizability across various multimodal tasks. In fact, there are numerous multimodal tasks requiring diverse reasoning skills, such as zooming in on a specific region or marking an object within an image. To address this, we propose unified generative multimodal reasoning, which unifies diverse multimodal reasoning skills by generating intermediate images during the reasoning process. We instantiate this paradigm with Omni-R1, a two-stage SFT+RL framework featuring perception alignment loss and perception reward, thereby enabling functional image generation. Additionally, we introduce Omni-R1-Zero, which eliminates the need for multimodal annotations by bootstrapping step-wise visualizations from text-only reasoning data. Empirical results show that Omni-R1 achieves unified generative reasoning across a wide range of multimodal tasks, and Omni-R1-Zero can match or even surpass Omni-R1 on average, suggesting a promising direction for generative multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Large-scale optimization is a key backbone of modern business decision-making. However, building these models is often labor-intensive and time-consuming. We address this by proposing LEAN-LLM-OPT, a LightwEight AgeNtic workflow construction framework for LLM-assisted large-scale OPTimization auto-formulation. LEAN-LLM-OPT takes as input a problem description together with associated datasets and orchestrates a team of LLM agents to produce an optimization formulation. Specifically, upon receiving a query, two upstream LLM agents dynamically construct a workflow that specifies, step-by-step, how optimization models for similar problems can be formulated. A downstream LLM agent then follows this workflow to generate the final output. Leveraging LLMs' text-processing capabilities and common modeling practices, the workflow decomposes the modeling task into a sequence of structured sub-tasks and offloads mechanical data-handling operations to auxiliary tools. This design alleviates the downstream agent's burden related to planning and data handling, allowing it to focus on the most challenging components that cannot be readily standardized. Extensive simulations show that LEAN-LLM-OPT, instantiated with GPT-4.1 and the open source gpt-oss-20B, achieves strong performance on large-scale optimization modeling tasks and is competitive with state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, in a Singapore Airlines choice-based revenue management use case, LEAN-LLM-OPT demonstrates practical value by achieving leading performance across a range of scenarios. Along the way, we introduce Large-Scale-OR and Air-NRM, the first comprehensive benchmarks for large-scale optimization auto-formulation.

In this work, we highlight Hierarchical Implicit Intent Alignment for Personalized GUI Agent (PersonalAlign), a new agent task that requires agents to leverage long-term user records as persistent context to resolve omitted preferences in vague instructions and anticipate latent routines by user state for proactive assistance. To facilitate this study, we introduce AndroidIntent, a benchmark designed to evaluate agents' ability in resolving vague instructions and providing proactive suggestions through reasoning over long-term user records. We annotated 775 user-specific preferences and 215 routines from 20k long-term records across different users for evaluation. Furthermore, we introduce Hierarchical Intent Memory Agent (HIM-Agent), which maintains a continuously updating personal memory and hierarchically organizes user preferences and routines for personalization. Finally, we evaluate a range of GUI agents on AndroidIntent, including GPT-5, Qwen3-VL, and UI-TARS, further results show that HIM-Agent significantly improves both execution and proactive performance by 15.7% and 7.3%.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems have evolved into practical LLM-driven collaborators for many applications, gaining robustness from diversity and cross-checking. However, multi-agent RL (MARL) training is resource-intensive and unstable: co-adapting teammates induce non-stationarity, and rewards are often sparse and high-variance. Therefore, we introduce \textbf{Multi-Agent Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (MATTRL)}, a framework that injects structured textual experience into multi-agent deliberation at inference time. MATTRL forms a multi-expert team of specialists for multi-turn discussions, retrieves and integrates test-time experiences, and reaches consensus for final decision-making. We also study credit assignment for constructing a turn-level experience pool, then reinjecting it into the dialogue. Across challenging benchmarks in medicine, math, and education, MATTRL improves accuracy by an average of 3.67\% over a multi-agent baseline, and by 8.67\% over comparable single-agent baselines. Ablation studies examine different credit-assignment schemes and provide a detailed comparison of how they affect training outcomes. MATTRL offers a stable, effective and efficient path to distribution-shift-robust multi-agent reasoning without tuning.

Abstract: Modern supply chains are increasingly exposed to disruptions from geopolitical events, demand shocks, trade restrictions, to natural disasters. While many of these disruptions originate deep in the supply network, most companies still lack visibility beyond Tier-1 suppliers, leaving upstream vulnerabilities undetected until the impact cascades downstream. To overcome this blind-spot and move from reactive recovery to proactive resilience, we introduce a minimally supervised agentic AI framework that autonomously monitors, analyses, and responds to disruptions across extended supply networks. The architecture comprises seven specialised agents powered by large language models and deterministic tools that jointly detect disruption signals from unstructured news, map them to multi-tier supplier networks, evaluate exposure based on network structure, and recommend mitigations such as alternative sourcing options. \rev{We evaluate the framework across 30 synthesised scenarios covering three automotive manufacturers and five disruption classes. The system achieves high accuracy across core tasks, with F1 scores between 0.962 and 0.991, and performs full end-to-end analyses in a mean of 3.83 minutes at a cost of \$0.0836 per disruption. Relative to industry benchmarks of multi-day, analyst-driven assessments, this represents a reduction of more than three orders of magnitude in response time. A real-world case study of the 2022 Russia-Ukraine conflict further demonstrates operational applicability. This work establishes a foundational step toward building resilient, proactive, and autonomous supply chains capable of managing disruptions across deep-tier networks.

Abstract: Unit tests are critical in the hardware design lifecycle to ensure that component design modules are functionally correct and conform to the specification before they are integrated at the system level. Thus developing unit tests targeting various design features requires deep understanding of the design functionality and creativity. When one or more unit tests expose a design failure, the debugging engineer needs to diagnose, localize, and debug the failure to ensure design correctness, which is often a painstaking and intense process. In this work, we introduce LAUDE, a unified unit-test generation and debugging framework for hardware designs that cross-pollinates the semantic understanding of the design source code with the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of foundational Large-Language Models (LLMs). LAUDE integrates prompt engineering and design execution information to enhance its unit test generation accuracy and code debuggability. We apply LAUDE with closed- and open-source LLMs to a large corpus of buggy hardware design codes derived from the VerilogEval dataset, where generated unit tests detected bugs in up to 100% and 93% of combinational and sequential designs and debugged up to 93% and 84% of combinational and sequential designs, respectively.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot, into professional workflows is increasingly reshaping software engineering practices. These tools have lowered the cost of code generation, explanation, and testing, while introducing new forms of automation into routine development tasks. In contrast, most of the software engineering and computer engineering curricula remain closely aligned with pedagogical models that equate manual syntax production with technical competence. This growing misalignment raises concerns regarding assessment validity, learning outcomes, and the development of foundational skills. Adopting a conceptual research approach, this paper proposes a theoretical framework for analyzing how generative AI alters core software engineering competencies and introduces a pedagogical design model for LLM-integrated education. Attention is given to computer engineering programs in Turkey, where centralized regulation, large class sizes, and exam-oriented assessment practices amplify these challenges. The framework delineates how problem analysis, design, implementation, and testing increasingly shift from construction toward critique, validation, and human-AI stewardship. In addition, the paper argues that traditional plagiarism-centric integrity mechanisms are becoming insufficient, motivating a transition toward a process transparency model. While this work provides a structured proposal for curriculum adaptation, it remains a theoretical contribution; the paper concludes by outlining the need for longitudinal empirical studies to evaluate these interventions and their long-term impacts on learning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive domains such as healthcare, finance, and law, yet their integration raises pressing concerns around trust, accountability, and reliability. This paper explores adaptive trust metrics for multi LLM ecosystems, proposing a framework for quantifying and improving model reliability under regulated constraints. By analyzing system behaviors, evaluating uncertainty across multiple LLMs, and implementing dynamic monitoring pipelines, the study demonstrates practical pathways for operational trustworthiness. Case studies from financial compliance and healthcare diagnostics illustrate the applicability of adaptive trust metrics in real world settings. The findings position adaptive trust measurement as a foundational enabler for safe and scalable AI adoption in regulated industries.

Abstract: Researchers face a persistent barrier when applying computational algorithms with parameter configuration typically demanding programming skills, interfaces differing across environments, and settings rarely persisting between sessions. This fragmentation forces repetitive input, slows iterative exploration, and undermines reproducibility because parameter choices are difficult to record, share, and reuse. We present EZInput, a cross-runtime environment Python library enabling algorithm developers to automatically generate graphical user interfaces that make their computational tools accessible to end-users without programming expertise. EZInput employs a declarative specification system where developers define input requirements and validation constraints once; the library then handles environment detection, interface rendering, parameter validation, and session persistence across Jupyter notebooks, Google Colab, and terminal environments. This "write once, run anywhere" architecture enables researchers to prototype in notebooks and deploy identical parameter configurations for batch execution on remote systems without code changes or manual transcription. Parameter persistence, inspired by ImageJ/FIJI and adapted to Python workflows, saves and restores user configurations via lightweight YAML files, eliminating redundant input and producing shareable records that enhance reproducibility. EZInput supports diverse input types essential for scientific computing and it also includes built-in validation that ensures data integrity and clear feedback that reduces user friction.

Abstract: OpenACC lowers the barrier to GPU offloading, but writing high-performing pragma remains complex, requiring deep domain expertise in memory hierarchies, data movement, and parallelization strategies. Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising potential solution for automated parallel code generation, but naive prompting often results in syntactically incorrect directives, uncompilable code, or performance that fails to exceed CPU baselines. We present a systematic prompt optimization approach to enhance OpenACC pragma generation without the prohibitive computational costs associated with model post-training. Leveraging the GEPA (GEnetic-PAreto) framework, we iteratively evolve prompts through a reflective feedback loop. This process utilizes crossover and mutation of instructions, guided by expert-curated gold examples and structured feedback based on clause- and clause parameter-level mismatches between the gold and predicted pragma. In our evaluation on the PolyBench suite, we observe an increase in compilation success rates for programs annotated with OpenACC pragma generated using the optimized prompts compared to those annotated using the simpler initial prompt, particularly for the "nano"-scale models. Specifically, with optimized prompts, the compilation success rate for GPT-4.1 Nano surged from 66.7% to 93.3%, and for GPT-5 Nano improved from 86.7% to 100%, matching or surpassing the capabilities of their significantly larger, more expensive versions. Beyond compilation, the optimized prompts resulted in a 21% increase in the number of programs that achieve functional GPU speedups over CPU baselines. These results demonstrate that prompt optimization effectively unlocks the potential of smaller, cheaper LLMs in writing stable and effective GPU-offloading directives, establishing a cost-effective pathway to automated directive-based parallelization in HPC workflows.

Abstract: Open source C code underpins society's computing infrastructure. Decades of work has helped harden C code against attackers, but C projects do not consist of only C code. C projects also contain build system code for automating development tasks like compilation, testing, and packaging. These build systems are critcal to software supply chain security and vulnerable to being poisoned, with the XZ Utils and SolarWinds attacks being recent examples. Existing techniques try to harden software supply chains by verifying software dependencies, but such methods ignore the build system itself. Similarly, classic software security checkers only analyze and monitor program code, not build system code. Moreover, poisoned build systems can easily circumvent tools for detecting program code vulnerabilities by disabling such checks. We present development phase isolation, a novel strategy for hardening build systems against poisoning by modeling the information and behavior permissions of build automation as if it were program code. We have prototyped this approach as a tool called Foreman, which successfully detects and warns about the poisoned test files involved in the XZ Utils attack. We outline our future plans to protect against pipeline poisoning by automatically checking development phase isolation. We envision a future where build system security checkers are as prevalent as program code checkers.

Abstract: Flaky tests are a common problem in software testing. They produce inconsistent results when executed multiple times on the same code, invalidating the assumption that a test failure indicates a software defect. Recent work on LLM-based test generation has identified flakiness as a potential problem with generated tests. However, its prevalence and underlying causes are unclear. We examined the flakiness of LLM-generated tests in the context of four relational database management systems: SAP HANA, DuckDB, MySQL, and SQLite. We amplified test suites with two LLMs, GPT-4o and Mistral-Large-Instruct-2407, to assess the flakiness of the generated test cases. Our results suggest that generated tests have a slightly higher proportion of flaky tests compared to existing tests. Based on a manual inspection, we found that the most common root cause of flakiness was the reliance of a test on a certain order that is not guaranteed ("unordered collection"), which was present in 72 of 115 flaky tests (63%). Furthermore, both LLMs transferred the flakiness from the existing tests to the newly generated tests via the provided prompt context. Our experiments suggest that flakiness transfer is more prevalent in closed-source systems such as SAP HANA than in open-source systems. Our study informs developers on what types of flakiness to expect from LLM-generated tests. It also highlights the importance of providing LLMs with tailored context when employing LLMs for test generation.

Abstract: In this work, we present SafePlanner, a systematic testing framework for identifying safety-critical flaws in the Plan model of Automated Driving Systems (ADS). SafePlanner targets two core challenges: generating structurally meaningful test scenarios and detecting hazardous planning behaviors. To maximize coverage, SafePlanner performs a structural analysis of the Plan model implementation - specifically, its scene-transition logic and hierarchical control flow - and uses this insight to extract feasible scene transitions from code. It then composes test scenarios by combining these transitions with non-player vehicle (NPC) behaviors. Guided fuzzing is applied to explore the behavioral space of the Plan model under these scenarios. We evaluate SafePlanner on Baidu Apollo, a production-grade level 4 ADS. It generates 20635 test cases and detects 520 hazardous behaviors, grouped into 15 root causes through manual analysis. For four of these, we applied patches based on our analysis; the issues disappeared, and no apparent side effects were observed. SafePlanner achieves 83.63 percent function and 63.22 percent decision coverage on the Plan model, outperforming baselines in both bug discovery and efficiency.

Abstract: The transition from Cloud-Native to AI-Native architectures is fundamentally reshaping software engineering, replacing deterministic microservices with probabilistic agentic services. However, this shift renders traditional black-box evaluation paradigms insufficient: existing benchmarks measure raw model capabilities while remaining blind to system-level execution dynamics. To bridge this gap, we introduce AI-NativeBench, the first application-centric and white-box AI-Native benchmark suite grounded in Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) standards. By treating agentic spans as first-class citizens within distributed traces, our methodology enables granular analysis of engineering characteristics beyond simple capabilities. Leveraging this benchmark across 21 system variants, we uncover critical engineering realities invisible to traditional metrics: a parameter paradox where lightweight models often surpass flagships in protocol adherence, a pervasive inference dominance that renders protocol overhead secondary, and an expensive failure pattern where self-healing mechanisms paradoxically act as cost multipliers on unviable workflows. This work provides the first systematic evidence to guide the transition from measuring model capability to engineering reliable AI-Native systems. To facilitate reproducibility and further research, we have open-sourced the benchmark and dataset.

Abstract: Deep learning libraries like Transformers and Megatron are now widely adopted in modern AI programs. However, when these libraries introduce defects, ranging from silent computation errors to subtle performance regressions, it is often challenging for downstream users to assess whether their own programs are affected. Such impact analysis requires not only understanding the defect semantics but also checking whether the client code satisfies complex triggering conditions involving configuration flags, runtime environments, and indirect API usage. We present DepRadar, an agent coordination framework for fine grained defect and impact analysis in DL library updates. DepRadar coordinates four specialized agents across three steps: 1. the PR Miner and Code Diff Analyzer extract structured defect semantics from commits or pull requests, 2. the Orchestrator Agent synthesizes these signals into a unified defect pattern with trigger conditions, and 3. the Impact Analyzer checks downstream programs to determine whether the defect can be triggered. To improve accuracy and explainability, DepRadar integrates static analysis with DL-specific domain rules for defect reasoning and client side tracing. We evaluate DepRadar on 157 PRs and 70 commits across two representative DL libraries. It achieves 90% precision in defect identification and generates high quality structured fields (average field score 1.6). On 122 client programs, DepRadar identifies affected cases with 90% recall and 80% precision, substantially outperforming other baselines.

Abstract: Domain-specific metadata schemas are essential to improve the findability and reusability of research software and to follow the FAIR4RS principles. However, many domains, including energy research, lack established metadata schemas. To address this gap, we developed a metadata schema for energy research software based on a requirement analysis and evaluated it through user testing. Our results show that the schema balances the need for formalization and interoperability, while also meeting the specific needs of energy researchers. Meanwhile, the testing showed that a good presentation of the required information is key to enable researchers to create the required metadata. This paper provides insights into the challenges and opportunities of designing a metadata schema for energy research software.

Abstract: Scientific Workflow Management Systems (SWfMSs) such as Nextflow have become essential software frameworks for conducting reproducible, scalable, and portable computational analyses in data-intensive fields like genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics. Building on Nextflow, the nf-core community curates standardized, peer-reviewed pipelines that follow strict testing, documentation, and governance guidelines. Despite its broad adoption, little is known about the challenges users face during the development and maintenance of these pipelines. This paper presents an empirical study of 25,173 issues and pull requests from these pipelines to uncover recurring challenges, management practices, and perceived difficulties. Using BERTopic modeling, we identify 13 key challenges, including pipeline development and integration, bug fixing, integrating genomic data, managing CI configurations, and handling version updates. We then examine issue resolution dynamics, showing that 89.38\% of issues and pull requests are eventually closed, with half resolved within three days. Statistical analysis reveals that the presence of labels (large effect, $δ$ = 0.94) and code snippets (medium effect, $δ$ = 0.50) significantly improve resolution likelihood. Further analysis reveals that tool development and repository maintenance poses the most significant challenges, followed by testing pipelines and CI configurations, and debugging containerized pipelines. Overall, this study provides actionable insights into the collaborative development and maintenance of nf-core pipelines, highlighting opportunities to enhance their usability, sustainability, and reproducibility.

Abstract: Reproducing system-level concurrency bugs requires both input data and the precise interleaving order of system calls. This process is challenging because such bugs are non-deterministic, and bug reports often lack the detailed information needed. Additionally, the unstructured nature of reports written in natural language makes it difficult to extract necessary details. Existing tools are inadequate to reproduce these bugs due to their inability to manage the specific interleaving at the system call level. To address these challenges, we propose SysPro, a novel approach that automatically extracts relevant system call names from bug reports and identifies their locations in the source code. It generates input data by utilizing information retrieval, regular expression matching, and the category-partition method. This extracted input and interleaving data are then used to reproduce bugs through dynamic source code instrumentation. Our empirical study on real-world benchmarks demonstrates that SysPro is both effective and efficient at localizing and reproducing system-level concurrency bugs from bug reports.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has strongly impacted software engineering, leading to a growing number of studies on automated unit test generation. However, the standalone use of LLMs without post-processing has proven insufficient, often producing tests that fail to compile or achieve high coverage. Several techniques have been proposed to address these issues, reporting improvements in test compilation and coverage. While important, LLM-based test generation techniques have been evaluated against relatively weak baselines (for todays' standards), i.e., old LLM versions and relatively weak prompts, which may exacerbate the performance contribution of the approaches. In other words, stronger (newer) LLMs may obviate any advantage these techniques bring. We investigate this issue by replicating four state-of-the-art LLM-based test generation tools, HITS, SymPrompt, TestSpark, and CoverUp that include engineering components aimed at guiding the test generation process through compilation and execution feedback, and evaluate their relative effectiveness and efficiency over a plain LLM test generation method. We integrate current LLM versions in all approaches and run an experiment on 393 classes and 3,657 methods. Our results show that the plain LLM approach can outperform previous state-of-the-art approaches in all test effectiveness metrics we used: line coverage (by 17.72%), branch coverage (by 19.80%) and mutation score (by 20.92%), and it does so at a comparable cost (LLM queries). We also observe that the granularity at which the plain LLM is applied has a significant impact on the cost. We therefore propose targeting first the program classes, where test generation is more efficient, and then the uncovered methods to reduce the number of LLM requests. This strategy achieves comparable (slightly higher) effectiveness while requiring about 20% fewer LLM requests.

Abstract: Code generation tasks aim to automate the conversion of user requirements into executable code, significantly reducing manual development efforts and enhancing software productivity. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced code generation, though their efficiency is still impacted by certain inherent architectural constraints. Each token generation necessitates a complete inference pass, requiring persistent retention of contextual information in memory and escalating resource consumption. While existing research prioritizes inference-phase optimizations such as prompt compression and model quantization, the generation phase remains underexplored. To tackle these challenges, we propose a knowledge-infused framework named ShortCoder, which optimizes code generation efficiency while preserving semantic equivalence and readability. In particular, we introduce: (1) ten syntax-level simplification rules for Python, derived from AST-preserving transformations, achieving 18.1% token reduction without functional compromise; (2) a hybrid data synthesis pipeline integrating rule-based rewriting with LLM-guided refinement, producing ShorterCodeBench, a corpus of validated tuples of original code and simplified code with semantic consistency; (3) a fine-tuning strategy that injects conciseness awareness into the base LLMs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ShortCoder consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on HumanEval, achieving an improvement of 18.1%-37.8% in generation efficiency over previous methods while ensuring the performance of code generation.
