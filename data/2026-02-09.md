Abstract: Satellite-terrestrial networks (STNs) have emerged as a promising architecture for providing seamless wireless coverage and connectivity for multiple users. However, potential malicious eavesdroppers pose a serious threat to the private information via STNs due to their non-cooperative behavior and ability to launch intelligent attacks. To address this challenge, we propose a cognitive secure communication framework driven by multiple agents that coordinates spectrum scheduling and protection through real-time sensing, thereby disrupting the judgment of eavesdroppers while preserving reliable data transmission. On this basis, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the secrecy probability of legitimate users, subject to a reliable transmission probability threshold. To tackle this problem, we propose a two-layer coordinated defense system. First, we develop a foundation layer based on multi-agent coordination schedule to determine the satellite operation matrix and the frequency slot occupation matrices, aiming to mitigate spectrum congestion and enhance transmission reliability. Then, we exploit generative adversarial networks to produce adversarial matrices, and employ learning-aided power control to set real and adversarial signal powers for protection layer, which actively degrades the inference capability of eavesdroppers. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms benchmark methods in terms of enhancing security performance and reducing power overhead for STNs in the cognitive secure communication scenario.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Biological AI tools for protein design and structure prediction are advancing rapidly, creating dual-use risks that existing safeguards cannot adequately address. Current model-level restrictions, including keyword filtering, output screening, and content-based access denials, are fundamentally ill-suited to biology, where reliable function prediction remains beyond reach and novel threats evade detection by design. We propose a three-tier Know Your Customer (KYC) framework, inspired by anti-money laundering (AML) practices in the financial sector, that shifts governance from content inspection to user verification and monitoring. Tier I leverages research institutions as trust anchors to vouch for affiliated researchers and assume responsibility for vetting. Tier II applies output screening through sequence homology searches and functional annotation. Tier III monitors behavioral patterns to detect anomalies inconsistent with declared research purposes. This layered approach preserves access for legitimate researchers while raising the cost of misuse through institutional accountability and traceability. The framework can be implemented immediately using existing institutional infrastructure, requiring no new legislation or regulatory mandates.

Abstract: Understanding TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in malware binaries is essential for security analysis and threat intelligence, yet remains challenging in practice. Real-world malware binaries are typically stripped of symbols, contain large numbers of functions, and distribute malicious behavior across multiple code regions, making TTP attribution difficult. Recent large language models (LLMs) offer strong code understanding capabilities, but applying them directly to this task faces challenges in identifying analysis entry points, reasoning under partial observability, and misalignment with TTP-specific decision logic. We present TTPDetect, the first LLM agent for recognizing TTPs in stripped malware binaries. TTPDetect combines dense retrieval with LLM-based neural retrieval to narrow the space of analysis entry points. TTPDetect further employs a function-level analyzing agent consisting of a Context Explorer that performs on-demand, incremental context retrieval and a TTP-Specific Reasoning Guideline that achieves inference-time alignment. We build a new dataset that labels decompiled functions with TTPs across diverse malware families and platforms. TTPDetect achieves 93.25% precision and 93.81% recall on function-level TTP recognition, outperforming baselines by 10.38% and 18.78%, respectively. When evaluated on real world malware samples, TTPDetect recognizes TTPs with a precision of 87.37%. For malware with expert-written reports, TTPDetect recovers 85.7% of the documented TTPs and further discovers, on average, 10.5 previously unreported TTPs per malware.

Abstract: Since most countries are coming up with online privacy regulations, such as GDPR in the EU, online publishers need to find a balance between revenue from targeted advertisement and user privacy. One way to be able to still show targeted ads, based on user personal and behavioral information, is to employ Federated Learning (FL), which performs distributed learning across users without sharing user raw data with other stakeholders in the publishing ecosystem. This paper presents AdFL, an FL framework that works in the browsers to learn user ad preferences. These preferences are aggregated in a global FL model, which is then used in the browsers to show more relevant ads to users. AdFL can work with any model that uses features available in the browser such as ad viewability, ad click-through, user dwell time on pages, and page content. The AdFL server runs at the publisher and coordinates the learning process for the users who browse pages on the publisher's website. The AdFL prototype does not require the client to install any software, as it is built utilizing standard APIs available on most modern browsers. We built a proof-of-concept model for ad viewability prediction that runs on top of AdFL. We tested AdFL and the model with two non-overlapping datasets from a website with 40K visitors per day. The experiments demonstrate AdFL's feasibility to capture the training information in the browser in a few milliseconds, show that the ad viewability prediction achieves up to 92.59% AUC, and indicate that utilizing differential privacy (DP) to safeguard local model parameters yields adequate performance, with only modest declines in comparison to the non-DP variant.

Abstract: The deployment of autonomous AI agents capable of executing commercial transactions has motivated the adoption of mandate-based payment authorization protocols, including the Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP) and the Agent Payments Protocol (AP2). These protocols replace interactive, session-based authorization with cryptographically issued mandates, enabling asynchronous and autonomous execution. While AP2 provides specification-level guarantees through signature verification, explicit binding, and expiration semantics, real-world agentic execution introduces runtime behaviors such as retries, concurrency, and orchestration that challenge implicit assumptions about mandate usage.
  In this work, we present a security analysis of the AP2 mandate lifecycle and identify enforcement gaps that arise during runtime in agent-based payment systems. We propose a zero-trust runtime verification framework that enforces explicit context binding and consume-once mandate semantics using dynamically generated, time-bound nonces, ensuring that authorization decisions are evaluated at execution time rather than assumed from static issuance properties.
  Through simulation-based evaluation under high concurrency, we show that context-aware binding and consume-once enforcement address distinct and complementary attack classes, and that both are required to prevent replay and context-redirect attacks. The proposed framework mitigates all evaluated attacks while maintaining stable verification latency of approximately 3.8~ms at throughput levels up to 10{,}000 transactions per second. We further demonstrate that the required runtime state is bounded by peak concurrency rather than cumulative transaction history, indicating that robust runtime security for agentic payment execution can be achieved with minimal and predictable overhead.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are pushing recommender systems (RecSys) toward content-grounded retrieval and ranking via cross-modal fusion. We find that while cross-modal consensus often mitigates conventional poisoning that manipulates interaction logs or perturbs a single modality, it also introduces a new attack surface where synchronised multimodal poisoning can reliably steer fused representations along stable semantic directions during fine-tuning. To characterise this threat, we formalise cross-modal interactive poisoning and propose VENOMREC, which performs Exposure Alignment to identify high-exposure regions in the joint embedding space and Cross-modal Interactive Perturbation to craft attention-guided coupled token-patch edits. Experiments on three real-world multimodal datasets demonstrate that VENOMREC consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving 0.73 mean ER@20 and improving over the strongest baseline by +0.52 absolute ER points on average, while maintaining comparable recommendation utility.

Abstract: The sharing of the last-level cache (LLC) among multiple cores makes it vulnerable to cross-core conflict- and occupancy-based attacks. Despite extensive prior work, modern processors still employ non-secure set-associative LLCs. Existing secure LLC designs broadly fall into two categories: (i) randomized and (ii) partitioned. The state-of-the-art randomized design, Mirage, mitigates conflict-based attacks but incurs significant area overhead (20% additional storage) and design complexity. Partitioned LLCs mitigate both conflict- and occupancy-based attacks, but often suffer from large performance overheads (on average over 5% and up to 49%), require OS support in set-based schemes, or face scalability issues in way-based schemes. These factors pose major obstacles to the industrial adoption of secure LLCs. This paper asks whether strong LLC security can be achieved with minimal changes to a conventional set-associative LLC, enabling security only when needed while preserving low performance, power, and area overheads. We propose Avatar, a secure and morphable LLC that supports three modes: non-secure (Avatar-N), randomized secure (Avatar-R), and partitioned secure (Avatar-P), and can switch dynamically between them. Avatar closely resembles a conventional set-associative LLC, facilitating industrial adoption. Avatar-R introduces extra invalid entries and leverages high associativity to provide a strong security guarantee with little capacity loss, achieving only one set-associative eviction per $10^{30}$ years, while incurring 1.5% storage overhead, a 2.7% increase in static power, and a 0.2% slowdown over a 16~MB baseline. Avatar-P mitigates both conflict- and occupancy-based attacks with only a 3% performance overhead, substantially outperforming prior way-based partitioned LLCs. When security is unnecessary, Avatar switches to Avatar-N to maximize performance and energy efficiency.

Abstract: We address the problem of runtime trajectory anomaly detection, a critical capability for enabling trustworthy LLM agents. Current safety measures predominantly focus on static input/output filtering. However, we argue that ensuring LLM agents reliability requires auditing the intermediate execution process. In this work, we formulate the task of Trajectory Anomaly Detection. The goal is not merely detection, but precise error localization. This capability is essential for enabling efficient rollback-and-retry. To achieve this, we construct TrajBench, a dataset synthesized via a perturb-and-complete strategy to cover diverse procedural anomalies. Using this benchmark, we investigate the capability of models in process supervision. We observe that general-purpose LLMs, even with zero-shot prompting, struggle to identify and localize these anomalies. This reveals that generalized capabilities do not automatically translate to process reliability. To address this, we propose TrajAD, a specialized verifier trained with fine-grained process supervision. Our approach outperforms baselines, demonstrating that specialized supervision is essential for building trustworthy agents.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (Graph RAG) is increasingly deployed to support LLM applications by augmenting user queries with structured knowledge retrieved from a knowledge graph. While Graph RAG improves relational reasoning, it introduces a largely understudied threat: adversaries can reconstruct subgraphs from a target RAG system's knowledge graph, enabling privacy inference and replication of curated knowledge assets. We show that existing attacks are largely ineffective against Graph RAG even with simple prompt-based safeguards, because these attacks expose explicit exfiltration intent and are therefore easily suppressed by lightweight safe prompts. We identify three technical challenges for practical Graph RAG extraction under realistic safeguards and introduce GRASP, a closed-box, multi-turn subgraph reconstruction attack. GRASP (i) reframes extraction as a context-processing task, (ii) enforces format-compliant, instance-grounded outputs via per-record identifiers to reduce hallucinations and preserve relational details, and (iii) diversifies goal-driven attack queries using a momentum-aware scheduler to operate within strict query budgets. Across two real-world knowledge graphs, four safety-aligned LLMs, and multiple Graph RAG frameworks, GRASP attains the strongest type-faithful reconstruction where prior methods fail, reaching up to 82.9 F1. We further evaluate defenses and propose two lightweight mitigations that substantially reduce reconstruction fidelity without utility loss.

Abstract: We present new auditors to assess Differential Privacy (DP) of an algorithm based on output samples. Such empirical auditors are common to check for algorithmic correctness and implementation bugs. Most existing auditors are batch-based or targeted toward the traditional notion of $(\varepsilon,δ)$-DP; typically both. In this work, we shift the focus to the highly expressive privacy concept of $f$-DP, in which the entire privacy behavior is captured by a single tradeoff curve. Our auditors detect violations across the full privacy spectrum with statistical significance guarantees, which are supported by theory and simulations. Most importantly, and in contrast to prior work, our auditors do not require a user-specified sample size as an input. Rather, they adaptively determine a near-optimal number of samples needed to reach a decision, thereby avoiding the excessively large sample sizes common in many auditing studies. This reduction in sampling cost becomes especially beneficial for expensive training procedures such as DP-SGD. Our method supports both whitebox and blackbox settings and can also be executed in single-run frameworks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent progress in ML and LLMs has improved vulnerability detection, and recent datasets have reduced label noise and unrelated code changes. However, most existing approaches still operate at the function level, where models are asked to predict whether a single function is vulnerable without inter-procedural context. In practice, vulnerability presence and root cause often depend on contextual information. Naively appending such context is not a reliable solution: real-world context is long, redundant, and noisy, and we find that unstructured context frequently degrades the performance of strong fine-tuned code models.
  We present CPRVul, a context-aware vulnerability detection framework that couples Context Profiling and Selection with Structured Reasoning. CPRVul constructs a code property graph, and extracts candidate context. It then uses an LLM to generate security-focused profiles and assign relevance scores, selecting only high-impact contextual elements that fit within the model's context window. In the second phase, CPRVul integrates the target function, the selected context, and auxiliary vulnerability metadata to generate reasoning traces, which are used to fine-tune LLMs for reasoning-based vulnerability detection.
  We evaluate CPRVul on three high-quality vulnerability datasets: PrimeVul, TitanVul, and CleanVul. Across all datasets, CPRVul consistently outperforms function-only baselines, achieving accuracies ranging from 64.94% to 73.76%, compared to 56.65% to 63.68% for UniXcoder. Specifically, on the challenging PrimeVul benchmark, CPRVul achieves 67.78% accuracy, outperforming prior state-of-the-art approaches, improving accuracy from 55.17% to 67.78% (22.9% improvement). Our ablations further show that neither raw context nor processed context alone benefits strong code models; gains emerge only when processed context is paired with structured reasoning.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models, including Large Language Models (LLMs), are characterized by a range of system-level attributes such as security and reliability. Recent studies have demonstrated that ML models are vulnerable to multiple forms of security violations, among which backdoor data-poisoning attacks represent a particularly insidious threat, enabling unauthorized model behavior and systematic misclassification. In parallel, deficiencies in model reliability can manifest as hallucinations in LLMs, leading to unpredictable outputs and substantial risks for end users. In this work on Dependable Artificial Intelligence with Reliability and Security (DAIReS), we propose a novel unified approach based on Syndrome Decoding for the detection of both security and reliability violations in learning-based systems. Specifically, we adapt the syndrome decoding approach to the NLP sentence-embedding space, enabling the discrimination of poisoned and non-poisoned samples within ML training datasets. Additionally, the same methodology can effectively detect hallucinated content due to self referential meta explanation tasks in LLMs.

Abstract: Automated detection of cyber attacks is a critical capability to counteract the growing volume and sophistication of cyber attacks. However, the high numbers of security alerts issued by intrusion detection systems lead to alert fatigue among analysts working in security operations centres (SOC), which in turn causes slow reaction time and incorrect decision making. Alert grouping, which refers to clustering of security alerts according to their underlying causes, can significantly reduce the number of distinct items analysts have to consider. Unfortunately, conventional time-based alert grouping solutions are unsuitable for large scale computer networks characterised by high levels of false positive alerts and simultaneously occurring attacks. To address these limitations, we propose AlertBERT, a self-supervised framework designed to group alerts from isolated or concurrent attacks in noisy environments. Thereby, our open-source implementation of AlertBERT leverages masked-language-models and density-based clustering to support both real-time or forensic operation. To evaluate our framework, we further introduce a novel data augmentation method that enables flexible control over noise levels and simulates concurrent attack occurrences. Based on the data sets generated through this method, we demonstrate that AlertBERT consistently outperforms conventional time-based grouping techniques, achieving superior accuracy in identifying correct alert groups.

Abstract: Third-party agent skills extend LLM-based agents with instruction files and executable code that run on users' machines. Skills execute with user privileges and are distributed through community registries with minimal vetting, but no ground-truth dataset exists to characterize the resulting threats. We construct the first labeled dataset of malicious agent skills by behaviorally verifying 98,380 skills from two community registries, confirming 157 malicious skills with 632 vulnerabilities. These attacks are not incidental. Malicious skills average 4.03 vulnerabilities across a median of three kill chain phases, and the ecosystem has split into two archetypes: Data Thieves that exfiltrate credentials through supply chain techniques, and Agent Hijackers that subvert agent decision-making through instruction manipulation. A single actor accounts for 54.1\% of confirmed cases through templated brand impersonation. Shadow features, capabilities absent from public documentation, appear in 0\% of basic attacks but 100\% of advanced ones; several skills go further by exploiting the AI platform's own hook system and permission flags. Responsible disclosure led to 93.6\% removal within 30 days. We release the dataset and analysis pipeline to support future work on agent skill security.

Abstract: This paper presents a survey of state-of-the-art trust models for Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs). Trust management plays an essential role in isolating malicious insider attacks in VANETs which traditional security approaches fail to thwart. To this end, many trust models are presented; some of them only address trust management, while others address security and privacy aspects besides trust management. This paper first reviews, classifies, and summarizes state-of-the-art trust models, and then compares their achievements. From this literature survey, our reader will easily identify two broad classes of trust models that exist in literature, differing primarily in their evaluation point. For example, most trust models follow receiver-side trust evaluation and to the best of our knowledge, there is only one trust model for VANETs which evaluates trust at the sender-side unless a dispute arises. In the presence of a dispute, a Roadside Unit (RSU) rules on the validity of an event. In receiver-side trust models, each receiver becomes busy while computing the trust of a sender and its messages upon the messages' arrival. Conversely, in the sender-side class, receivers are free from any kind of computation as the trust is verified at the time the message is announced. Also, vehicles can quickly act on the information, such as taking a detour to an alternate route, as it supports fast decision-making. We provide a comparison between these two evaluation techniques using a sequence diagram. We then conclude the survey by suggesting future work for sender-side evaluation of trust in VANETs. Additionally, the challenges (real-time constraints and efficiency) are emphasized whilst considering the deployment of a trust model in VANETs

Abstract: As Low Earth Orbit (LEO) become mega-constellations critical infrastructure, attacks targeting them have grown in number and range. The security analysis of LEO constellations faces a fundamental paradigm gap: traditional topology-centric methods fail to capture systemic risks arising from dynamic load imbalances and high-order dependencies, which can transform localized failures into network-wide cascades. To address this, we propose HYDRA, a hypergraph-based dynamic risk analysis framework. Its core is a novel metric, Hyper-Bridge Centrality (HBC), which quantifies node criticality via a load-to-redundancy ratio within dependency structures. A primary challenge to resilience: the most critical vulnerabilities are not in the densely connected satellite core, but in the seemingly marginal ground-space interfaces. These are the system's "Black Swan" nodes--topologically peripheral yet structurally lethal. We validate this through extensive simulations using realistic StarLink TLE data and population-based gravity model. Experiments demonstrate that HBC consistently outperforms traditional metrics, identifying critical failure points that surpass the structural damage potential of even betweenness centrality. This work shifts the security paradigm from connectivity to structural stress, demonstrating that securing the network edge is paramount and necessitates a fundamental redesign of redundancy strategies.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is increasingly deployed in real-world applications, where its reference-grounded design makes outputs appear trustworthy. This trust has spurred research on poisoning attacks that craft malicious content, inject it into knowledge sources, and manipulate RAG responses. However, when evaluated in practical RAG systems, existing attacks suffer from severely degraded effectiveness. This gap stems from two overlooked realities: (i) content is often processed before use, which can fragment the poison and weaken its effect, and (ii) users often do not issue the exact queries anticipated during attack design. These factors can lead practitioners to underestimate risks and develop a false sense of security. To better characterize the threat to practical systems, we present Confundo, a learning-to-poison framework that fine-tunes a large language model as a poison generator to achieve high effectiveness, robustness, and stealthiness. Confundo provides a unified framework supporting multiple attack objectives, demonstrated by manipulating factual correctness, inducing biased opinions, and triggering hallucinations. By addressing these overlooked challenges, Confundo consistently outperforms a wide range of purpose-built attacks across datasets and RAG configurations by large margins, even in the presence of defenses. Beyond exposing vulnerabilities, we also present a defensive use case that protects web content from unauthorized incorporation into RAG systems via scraping, with no impact on user experience.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Suffix-based jailbreak attacks append an adversarial suffix, i.e., a short token sequence, to steer aligned LLMs into unsafe outputs. Since suffixes are free-form text, they admit endlessly many surface forms, making jailbreak mitigation difficult. Most existing defenses depend on passive detection of suspicious suffixes, without leveraging the defender's inherent asymmetric ability to inject secrets and proactively conceal gaps. Motivated by this, we take a controllability-oriented perspective and develop a proactive defense that nudges attackers into a no-win dilemma: either they fall into defender-designed optimization traps and fail to produce an effective adversarial suffix, or they can succeed only by generating adversarial suffixes that carry distinctive, traceable fingerprints. We propose TrapSuffix, a lightweight fine-tuning approach that injects trap-aligned behaviors into the base model without changing the inference pipeline. TrapSuffix channels jailbreak attempts into these two outcomes by reshaping the model's response landscape to adversarial suffixes. Across diverse suffix-based jailbreak settings, TrapSuffix reduces the average attack success rate to below 0.01 percent and achieves an average tracing success rate of 87.9 percent, providing both strong defense and reliable traceability. It introduces no inference-time overhead and incurs negligible memory cost, requiring only 15.87 MB of additional memory on average, whereas state-of-the-art LLM-based detection defenses typically incur memory overheads at the 1e4 MB level, while composing naturally with existing filtering-based defenses for complementary protection.

Abstract: Random Access Channel (RACH) jamming poses a critical security threat to 5G and beyond (B5G) networks. This paper presents an analytical model for predicting the impact of Msg1 jamming attacks on RACH performance. We use the OpenAirInterface (OAI) open-source user equipment (UE) to implement a Msg1 jamming attacker. Over-the-air experiments validate the accuracy of the proposed analytical model. The results show that low-power and stealthy Msg1 jamming can effectively block legitimate UE access in 5G/B5G systems.

Abstract: Over the last years, Ethereum has evolved into a public platform that safeguards the savings of hundreds of millions of people and secures more than $650 billion in assets, placing it among the top 25 stock exchanges worldwide in market capitalization, ahead of Singapore, Mexico, and Thailand. As such, the performance and security of the Ethereum blockchain are not only of theoretical interest, but also carry significant global economic implications. At the time of writing, the Ethereum platform is collectively secured by almost one million validators highlighting its decentralized nature and underlining its economic security guarantees. However, due to this large validator set, the protocol takes around 15 minutes to finalize a block which is prohibitively slow for many real world applications. This delay is largely driven by the cost of aggregating and disseminating signatures across a validator set of this scale. Furthermore, as we show in this paper, the existing protocol that is used to aggregate and disseminate the signatures has several shortcomings that can be exploited by adversaries to shift stake proportion from honest to adversarial nodes. In this paper, we introduce Wonderboom, the first million scale aggregation protocol that can efficiently aggregate the signatures of millions of validators in a single Ethereum slot (x32 faster) while offering higher security guarantees than the state of the art protocol used in Ethereum. Furthermore, to evaluate Wonderboom, we implement the first simulation tool that can simulate such a protocol on the million scale and show that even in the worst case Wonderboom can aggregate and verify more than 2 million signatures within a single Ethereum slot.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in vulnerability detection. However, a critical reliability gap persists: models frequently yield correct detection verdicts based on hallucinated logic or superficial patterns that deviate from the actual root cause. This misalignment remains largely obscured because contemporary benchmarks predominantly prioritize coarse-grained classification metrics, lacking the granular ground truth required to evaluate the underlying reasoning process. To bridge this gap, we first construct a benchmark consisting of two datasets: (1) real-world vulnerabilities with expert-curated causal reasoning as ground truth, and (2) semantically equivalent code perturbations for assessing reasoning robustness. Our large-scale empirical study reveals that even state-of-the-art models struggle to maintain logical consistency during semantic code comprehension, exhibiting 12 systematic failure patterns. Addressing these limitations, we propose DAGVul, a novel framework that models vulnerability reasoning as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) generation task. Unlike linear chain-of-thought (CoT), our approach explicitly maps causal dependencies to enforce structural consistency. By further introducing Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), we align model reasoning trace with program-intrinsic logic. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework improves the reasoning F1-score by an average of 18.9% over all the baselines. Remarkably, our 8B-parameter implementation not only outperforms existing models of comparable scale but also surpasses specialized large-scale reasoning models, including Qwen3-30B-Reasoning and GPT-OSS-20B-High. It is even competitive with state-of-the-art models like Claude-Sonnet-4.5 (75.47% vs. 76.11%), establishing new efficiency in vulnerability reasoning across model scales.

Abstract: Graph-structured data underpin a wide spectrum of modern applications. However, complex graph topologies and homophilic patterns can facilitate attribute inference attacks (AIAs) by enabling sensitive information leakage to propagate across local neighborhoods. Existing AIAs predominantly assume that adversaries can probe sensitive attributes through repeated model queries. Such assumptions are often impractical in real-world settings due to stringent data protection regulations, prohibitive query budgets, and heightened detection risks, especially when inferring multiple sensitive attributes. More critically, this model-centric perspective obscures a pervasive blind spot: \textbf{intrinsic multiple sensitive information leakage arising solely from publicly released graphs.} To exploit this unexplored vulnerability, we introduce a new attack paradigm and propose \textbf{Taipan, the first query-free transfer-based attack framework for multiple sensitive attribute inference attacks on graphs (G-MSAIAs).} Taipan integrates \emph{Hierarchical Attack Knowledge Routing} to capture intricate inter-attribute correlations, and \emph{Prompt-guided Attack Prototype Refinement} to mitigate negative transfer and performance degradation. We further present a systematic evaluation framework tailored to G-MSAIAs. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world graph datasets demonstrate that Taipan consistently achieves strong attack performance across same-distribution settings and heterogeneous similar- and out-of-distribution settings with mismatched feature dimensionalities, and remains effective even under rigorous differential privacy guarantees. Our findings underscore the urgent need for more robust multi-attribute privacy-preserving graph publishing methods and data-sharing practices.

Abstract: Citations provide the basis for trusting scientific claims; when they are invalid or fabricated, this trust collapses. With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), this risk has intensified: LLMs are increasingly used for academic writing, yet their tendency to fabricate citations (``ghost citations'') poses a systemic threat to citation validity.
  To quantify this threat and inform mitigation, we develop CiteVerifier, an open-source framework for large-scale citation verification, and conduct the first comprehensive study of citation validity in the LLM era through three experiments built on it. We benchmark 13 state-of-the-art LLMs on citation generation across 40 research domains, finding that all models hallucinate citations at rates from 14.23\% to 94.93\%, with significant variation across research domains. Moreover, we analyze 2.2 million citations from 56,381 papers published at top-tier AI/ML and Security venues (2020--2025), confirming that 1.07\% of papers contain invalid or fabricated citations (604 papers), with an 80.9\% increase in 2025 alone. Furthermore, we survey 97 researchers and analyze 94 valid responses after removing 3 conflicting samples, revealing a critical ``verification gap'': 41.5\% of researchers copy-paste BibTeX without checking and 44.4\% choose no-action responses when encountering suspicious references; meanwhile, 76.7\% of reviewers do not thoroughly check references and 80.0\% never suspect fake citations. Our findings reveal an accelerating crisis where unreliable AI tools, combined with inadequate human verification by researchers and insufficient peer review scrutiny, enable fabricated citations to contaminate the scientific record. We propose interventions for researchers, venues, and tool developers to protect citation integrity.

Abstract: LLM watermarks allow tracing AI-generated texts by inserting a detectable signal into their generated content. Recent works have proposed a wide range of watermarking algorithms, each with distinct designs, usually built using a bottom-up approach. Crucially, there is no general and principled formulation for LLM watermarking.
  In this work, we show that most existing and widely used watermarking schemes can in fact be derived from a principled constrained optimization problem. Our formulation unifies existing watermarking methods and explicitly reveals the constraints that each method optimizes. In particular, it highlights an understudied quality-diversity-power trade-off. At the same time, our framework also provides a principled approach for designing novel watermarking schemes tailored to specific requirements. For instance, it allows us to directly use perplexity as a proxy for quality, and derive new schemes that are optimal with respect to this constraint. Our experimental evaluation validates our framework: watermarking schemes derived from a given constraint consistently maximize detection power with respect to that constraint.

Abstract: Accounting for privacy loss under fully adaptive composition -- where both the choice of mechanisms and their privacy parameters may depend on the entire history of prior outputs -- is a central challenge in differential privacy (DP). In this setting, privacy filters are stopping rules for compositions that ensure a prescribed global privacy budget is not exceeded. It remains unclear whether optimal trade-off-function-based notions, such as $f$-DP, admit valid privacy filters under fully adaptive interaction. We show that the natural approach to defining an $f$-DP filter -- composing individual trade-off curves and stopping when the prescribed $f$-DP curve is crossed -- is fundamentally invalid. We characterise when and why this failure occurs, and establish necessary and sufficient conditions under which the natural filter is valid. Furthermore, we prove a fully adaptive central limit theorem for $f$-DP and construct an approximate Gaussian DP filter for subsampled Gaussian mechanisms at small sampling rates $q<0.2$ and large sampling rates $q>0.8$, yielding tighter privacy guarantees than filters based on Rényi DP in the same setting.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Modern AI-integrated IDEs are shifting from passive code completion to proactive Next Edit Suggestions (NES). Unlike traditional autocompletion, NES is designed to construct a richer context from both recent user interactions and the broader codebase to suggest multi-line, cross-line, or even cross-file modifications. This evolution significantly streamlines the programming workflow into a tab-by-tab interaction and enhances developer productivity. Consequently, NES introduces a more complex context retrieval mechanism and sophisticated interaction patterns. However, existing studies focus almost exclusively on the security implications of standalone LLM-based code generation, ignoring the potential attack vectors posed by NES in modern AI-integrated IDEs. The underlying mechanisms of NES remain under-explored, and their security implications are not yet fully understood.
  In this paper, we conduct the first systematic security study of NES systems. First, we perform an in-depth dissection of the NES mechanisms to understand the newly introduced threat vectors. It is found that NES retrieves a significantly expanded context, including inputs from imperceptible user actions and global codebase retrieval, which increases the attack surfaces. Second, we conduct a comprehensive in-lab study to evaluate the security implications of NES. The evaluation results reveal that NES is susceptible to context poisoning and is sensitive to transactional edits and human-IDE interactions. Third, we perform a large-scale online survey involving over 200 professional developers to assess the perceptions of NES security risks in real-world development workflows. The survey results indicate a general lack of awareness regarding the potential security pitfalls associated with NES, highlighting the need for increased education and improved security countermeasures in AI-integrated IDEs.

Abstract: This project explores large language models (LLMs) for anomaly detection across heterogeneous log sources. Traditional intrusion detection systems suffer from high false positive rates, semantic blindness, and data scarcity, as logs are inherently sensitive, making clean datasets rare. We address these challenges through three contributions: (1) LogAtlas-Foundation-Sessions and LogAtlas-Defense-Set, balanced and heterogeneous log datasets with explicit attack annotations and privacy preservation; (2) empirical benchmarking revealing why standard metrics such as F1 and accuracy are misleading for security applications; and (3) a two phase training framework combining log understanding (Base-AMAN, 3B parameters) with real time detection (AMAN, 0.5B parameters via knowledge distillation). Results demonstrate practical feasibility, with inference times of 0.3-0.5 seconds per session and operational costs below 50 USD per day.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in security-sensitive applications, yet remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks. However, existing backdoor defenses are difficult to operationalize for Backdoor Defense-as-a-Service (BDaaS), as they require unrealistic side information (e.g., downstream clean data, known triggers/targets, or task domain specifics), and lack reusable, scalable purification across diverse backdoored models. In this paper, we present PROTOPURIFY, a backdoor purification framework via parameter edits under minimal assumptions. PROTOPURIFY first builds a backdoor vector pool from clean and backdoored model pairs, aggregates vectors into candidate prototypes, and selects the most aligned candidate for the target model via similarity matching. PROTOPURIFY then identifies a boundary layer through layer-wise prototype alignment and performs targeted purification by suppressing prototype-aligned components in the affected layers, achieving fine-grained mitigation with minimal impact on benign utility. Designed as a BDaaS-ready primitive, PROTOPURIFY supports reusability, customizability, interpretability, and runtime efficiency. Experiments across various LLMs on both classification and generation tasks show that PROTOPURIFY consistently outperforms 6 representative defenses against 6 diverse attacks, including single-trigger, multi-trigger, and triggerless backdoor settings. PROTOPURIFY reduces ASR to below 10%, and even as low as 1.6% in some cases, while incurring less than a 3% drop in clean utility. PROTOPURIFY further demonstrates robustness against adaptive backdoor variants and stability on non-backdoored models.

Abstract: As increasingly capable open-weight large language models (LLMs) are deployed, improving their tamper resistance against unsafe modifications, whether accidental or intentional, becomes critical to minimize risks. However, there is no standard approach to evaluate tamper resistance. Varied data sets, metrics, and tampering configurations make it difficult to compare safety, utility, and robustness across different models and defenses. To this end, we introduce TamperBench, the first unified framework to systematically evaluate the tamper resistance of LLMs. TamperBench (i) curates a repository of state-of-the-art weight-space fine-tuning attacks and latent-space representation attacks; (ii) enables realistic adversarial evaluation through systematic hyperparameter sweeps per attack-model pair; and (iii) provides both safety and utility evaluations. TamperBench requires minimal additional code to specify any fine-tuning configuration, alignment-stage defense method, and metric suite while ensuring end-to-end reproducibility. We use TamperBench to evaluate 21 open-weight LLMs, including defense-augmented variants, across nine tampering threats using standardized safety and capability metrics with hyperparameter sweeps per model-attack pair. This yields novel insights, including effects of post-training on tamper resistance, that jailbreak-tuning is typically the most severe attack, and that Triplet emerges as a leading alignment-stage defense.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs) remains expensive, particularly because the rollout is expensive. Decoupling rollout generation from policy optimization (e.g., leveraging a more efficient model to rollout) could enable substantial efficiency gains, yet doing so introduces a severe distribution mismatch that destabilizes learning. We propose Jackpot, a framework that leverages Optimal Budget Rejection Sampling (OBRS) to directly reduce the discrepancy between the rollout model and the evolving policy. Jackpot integrates a principled OBRS procedure, a unified training objective that jointly updates the policy and rollout models, and an efficient system implementation enabled by top-$k$ probability estimation and batch-level bias correction. Our theoretical analysis shows that OBRS consistently moves the rollout distribution closer to the target distribution under a controllable acceptance budget. Empirically, \sys substantially improves training stability compared to importance-sampling baselines, achieving performance comparable to on-policy RL when training Qwen3-8B-Base for up to 300 update steps of batchsize 64. Taken together, our results show that OBRS-based alignment brings us a step closer to practical and effective decoupling of rollout generation from policy optimization for RL for LLMs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable reasoning capabilities, achieving impressive results across a wide range of tasks. Despite these advances, significant reasoning failures persist, occurring even in seemingly simple scenarios. To systematically understand and address these shortcomings, we present the first comprehensive survey dedicated to reasoning failures in LLMs. We introduce a novel categorization framework that distinguishes reasoning into embodied and non-embodied types, with the latter further subdivided into informal (intuitive) and formal (logical) reasoning. In parallel, we classify reasoning failures along a complementary axis into three types: fundamental failures intrinsic to LLM architectures that broadly affect downstream tasks; application-specific limitations that manifest in particular domains; and robustness issues characterized by inconsistent performance across minor variations. For each reasoning failure, we provide a clear definition, analyze existing studies, explore root causes, and present mitigation strategies. By unifying fragmented research efforts, our survey provides a structured perspective on systemic weaknesses in LLM reasoning, offering valuable insights and guiding future research towards building stronger, more reliable, and robust reasoning capabilities. We additionally release a comprehensive collection of research works on LLM reasoning failures, as a GitHub repository at https://github.com/Peiyang-Song/Awesome-LLM-Reasoning-Failures, to provide an easy entry point to this area.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework for the logical specification of non-Markovian rewards in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with large state spaces. Our approach leverages Linear Temporal Logic Modulo Theories over finite traces (LTLfMT), a more expressive extension of classical temporal logic in which predicates are first-order formulas of arbitrary first-order theories rather than simple Boolean variables. This enhanced expressiveness enables the specification of complex tasks over unstructured and heterogeneous data domains, promoting a unified and reusable framework that eliminates the need for manual predicate encoding. However, the increased expressive power of LTLfMT introduces additional theoretical and computational challenges compared to standard LTLf specifications. We address these challenges from a theoretical standpoint, identifying a fragment of LTLfMT that is tractable but sufficiently expressive for reward specification in an infinite-state-space context. From a practical perspective, we introduce a method based on reward machines and Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) to translate first-order logic specifications and address reward sparsity. We evaluate this approach to a continuous-control setting using Non-Linear Arithmetic Theory, showing that it enables natural specification of complex tasks. Experimental results show how a tailored implementation of HER is fundamental in solving tasks with complex goals.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in high-stakes domains where optimal actions depend on both uncertainty about the world and consideration of utilities of different outcomes, yet their decision logic remains difficult to interpret. We study whether LLMs are rational utility maximizers with coherent beliefs and stable preferences. We consider behaviors of models for diagnosis challenge problems. The results provide insights about the relationship of LLM inferences to ideal Bayesian utility maximization for elicited probabilities and observed actions. Our approach provides falsifiable conditions under which the reported probabilities \emph{cannot} correspond to the true beliefs of any rational agent. We apply this methodology to multiple medical diagnostic domains with evaluations across several LLMs. We discuss implications of the results and directions forward for uses of LLMs in guiding high-stakes decisions.

Abstract: Current tokenization methods process sequential data without accounting for signal quality, limiting their effectiveness on noisy real-world corpora. We present QA-Token (Quality-Aware Tokenization), which incorporates data reliability directly into vocabulary construction. We make three key contributions: (i) a bilevel optimization formulation that jointly optimizes vocabulary construction and downstream performance, (ii) a reinforcement learning approach that learns merge policies through quality-aware rewards with convergence guarantees, and (iii) an adaptive parameter learning mechanism via Gumbel-Softmax relaxation for end-to-end optimization. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates consistent improvements: genomics (6.7 percentage point F1 gain in variant calling over BPE), finance (30% Sharpe ratio improvement). At foundation scale, we tokenize a pretraining corpus comprising 1.7 trillion base-pairs and achieve state-of-the-art pathogen detection (94.53 MCC) while reducing token count by 15%. We unlock noisy real-world corpora, spanning petabases of genomic sequences and terabytes of financial time series, for foundation model training with zero inference overhead.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have advanced rapidly; however, existing benchmarks in mathematics, code, and common-sense reasoning remain limited. They lack long-context evaluation, offer insufficient challenge, and provide answers that are difficult to verify programmatically. We introduce GrAlgoBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LRMs through graph algorithm problems. Such problems are particularly well suited for probing reasoning abilities: they demand long-context reasoning, allow fine-grained control of difficulty levels, and enable standardized, programmatic evaluation. Across nine tasks, our systematic experiments reveal two major weaknesses of current LRMs. First, accuracy deteriorates sharply as context length increases, falling below 50% once graphs exceed 120 nodes. This degradation is driven by frequent execution errors, weak memory, and redundant reasoning. Second, LRMs suffer from an over-thinking phenomenon, primarily caused by extensive yet largely ineffective self-verification, which inflates reasoning traces without improving correctness. By exposing these limitations, GrAlgoBench establishes graph algorithm problems as a rigorous, multidimensional, and practically relevant testbed for advancing the study of reasoning in LRMs. Code is available at https://github.com/Bklight999/GrAlgoBench.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: GUI grounding maps natural language instructions to the correct interface elements, serving as the perception foundation for GUI agents. Existing approaches predominantly rely on fine-tuning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) using large-scale GUI datasets to predict target element coordinates, which is data-intensive and generalizes poorly to unseen interfaces. Recent attention-based alternatives exploit localization signals in MLLMs attention mechanisms without task-specific fine-tuning, but suffer from low reliability due to the lack of explicit and complementary spatial anchors in GUI images. To address this limitation, we propose Trifuse, an attention-based grounding framework that explicitly integrates complementary spatial anchors. Trifuse integrates attention, OCR-derived textual cues, and icon-level caption semantics via a Consensus-SinglePeak (CS) fusion strategy that enforces cross-modal agreement while retaining sharp localization peaks. Extensive evaluations on four grounding benchmarks demonstrate that Trifuse achieves strong performance without task-specific fine-tuning, substantially reducing the reliance on expensive annotated data. Moreover, ablation studies reveal that incorporating OCR and caption cues consistently improves attention-based grounding performance across different backbones, highlighting its effectiveness as a general framework for GUI grounding.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), exemplified by DeepSeek-R1, have underscored the potential of scaling inference-time compute through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). However, GRPO frequently suffers from gradient signal attenuation when encountering problems that are either too trivial or overly complex. In these scenarios, the disappearance of inter-group advantages makes the gradient signal susceptible to noise, thereby jeopardizing convergence stability. While variants like DAPO attempt to rectify gradient vanishing, they do not alleviate the substantial computational overhead incurred by exhaustive rollouts on low-utility samples. In this paper, we propose Difficulty-Estimated Policy Optimization (DEPO), a novel framework designed to optimize the efficiency and robustness of reasoning alignment. DEPO integrates an online Difficulty Estimator that dynamically assesses and filters training data before the rollout phase. This mechanism ensures that computational resources are prioritized for samples with high learning potential. Empirical results demonstrate that DEPO achieves up to a 2x reduction in rollout costs without compromising model performance. Our approach significantly lowers the computational barrier for training high-performance reasoning models, offering a more sustainable path for reasoning scaling. Code and data will be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning capabilities, yet their performance often deteriorates sharply in long-horizon tasks, exhibiting systematic breakdown beyond certain scales. Conventional explanations primarily attribute this phenomenon to task complexity, such as combinatorial search explosion or long-term credit assignment challenges. In this work, we argue that these explanations are incomplete: even in linear, unbranched tasks without semantic ambiguity, autoregressive execution is subject to an intrinsic stability limit.
  We propose that the fundamental constraint on long-horizon reasoning arises from process-level instability in autoregressive generation rather than solely from search or task complexity, reframing long-horizon reasoning as a problem of structural governance. We derive Theorem~A, showing that decision advantage in single-path autoregressive reasoning decays exponentially with execution length, imposing a fundamental bound on maintainable reasoning chains. This result implies a structural consequence: stable long-horizon reasoning requires discrete segmentation, naturally inducing graph-like execution structures such as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).
  Empirical studies in both synthetic environments and real TextWorld tasks reveal observable performance cliffs consistent with theoretical predictions. Our findings provide a dynamical perspective on long-horizon reasoning failure and suggest new limitations on maintaining long-term coherence under purely autoregressive architectures. Furthermore, we highlight that short-horizon evaluation protocols may obscure structural instability, indicating a potential shift from scaling toward structured governance in future reasoning systems.

We identify three primary bottlenecks hindering the performance of edge-scale models: catastrophic forgetting during Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), sensitivity to reward signal noise during Reinforcement Learning (RL), and reasoning degradation caused by redundant information in long-context scenarios. To address the issues, we propose AgentCPM-Explore, a compact 4B agent model with high knowledge density and strong exploration capability. We introduce a holistic training framework featuring parameter-space model fusion, reward signal denoising, and contextual information refinement. Through deep exploration, AgentCPM-Explore achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among 4B-class models, matches or surpasses 8B-class SOTA models on four benchmarks, and even outperforms larger-scale models such as Claude-4.5-Sonnet or DeepSeek-v3.2 in five benchmarks. Notably, AgentCPM-Explore achieves 97.09% accuracy on GAIA text-based tasks under pass@64. These results provide compelling evidence that the bottleneck for edge-scale models is not their inherent capability ceiling, but rather their inference stability. Based on our well-established training framework, AgentCPM-Explore effectively unlocks the significant, yet previously underestimated, potential of edge-scale models.

Abstract: Evaluating agentic AI on open-ended professional tasks faces a fundamental dilemma between rigor and flexibility. Static rubrics provide rigorous, reproducible assessment but fail to accommodate diverse valid response strategies, while LLM-as-a-judge approaches adapt to individual responses yet suffer from instability and bias. Human experts address this dilemma by combining domain-grounded principles with dynamic, claim-level assessment. Inspired by this process, we propose JADE, a two-layer evaluation framework. Layer 1 encodes expert knowledge as a predefined set of evaluation skills, providing stable evaluation criteria. Layer 2 performs report-specific, claim-level evaluation to flexibly assess diverse reasoning strategies, with evidence-dependency gating to invalidate conclusions built on refuted claims. Experiments on BizBench show that JADE improves evaluation stability and reveals critical agent failure modes missed by holistic LLM-based evaluators. We further demonstrate strong alignment with expert-authored rubrics and effective transfer to a medical-domain benchmark, validating JADE across professional domains. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/smiling-world/JADE.

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute with multi-path chain-of-thought improves reasoning accuracy, but its effectiveness depends critically on the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Existing approaches address this trade-off in rigid ways: tree-structured search hard-codes exploration through brittle expansion rules that interfere with post-trained reasoning, while parallel reasoning over-explores redundant hypothesis paths and relies on weak answer selection. Motivated by the observation that the optimal balance is phase-dependent and that correct and incorrect reasoning paths often diverge only at late stages, we reformulate test-time scaling as a dynamic expand-reduce control problem over a pool of hypotheses. We propose HyPER, a training-free online control policy for multi-path decoding in mixture-of-experts models that reallocates computation under a fixed budget using lightweight path statistics. HyPER consists of an online controller that transitions from exploration to exploitation as the hypothesis pool evolves, a token-level refinement mechanism that enables efficient generation-time exploitation without full-path resampling, and a length- and confidence-aware aggregation strategy for reliable answer-time exploitation. Experiments on four mixture-of-experts language models across diverse reasoning benchmarks show that HyPER consistently achieves a superior accuracy-compute trade-off, improving accuracy by 8 to 10 percent while reducing token usage by 25 to 40 percent.

Abstract: Generating deep research reports requires large-scale information acquisition and the synthesis of insight-driven analysis, posing a significant challenge for current language models. Most existing approaches follow a plan-then-write paradigm, whose performance heavily depends on the quality of the initial outline. However, constructing a comprehensive outline itself demands strong reasoning ability, causing current deep research systems to rely almost exclusively on closed-source or online large models. This reliance raises practical barriers to deployment and introduces safety and privacy concerns for user-authored data. In this work, we present AgentCPM-Report, a lightweight yet high-performing local solution composed of a framework that mirrors the human writing process and an 8B-parameter deep research agent. Our framework uses a Writing As Reasoning Policy (WARP), which enables models to dynamically revise outlines during report generation. Under this policy, the agent alternates between Evidence-Based Drafting and Reasoning-Driven Deepening, jointly supporting information acquisition, knowledge refinement, and iterative outline evolution. To effectively equip small models with this capability, we introduce a Multi-Stage Agentic Training strategy, consisting of cold-start, atomic skill RL, and holistic pipeline RL. Experiments on DeepResearch Bench, DeepConsult, and DeepResearch Gym demonstrate that AgentCPM-Report outperforms leading closed-source systems, with substantial gains in Insight.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as the predominant paradigm for training large language model (LLM)-based AI agents. However, existing backbone RL algorithms lack verified convergence guarantees in agentic scenarios, especially in multi-turn settings, which can lead to training instability and failure to converge to optimal policies.
  In this paper, we systematically analyze how different combinations of policy update mechanisms and advantage estimation methods affect convergence properties in single/multi-turn scenarios. We find that REINFORCE with Group Relative Advantage Estimation (GRAE) can converge to the globally optimal under undiscounted conditions, but the combination of PPO & GRAE breaks PPO's original monotonic improvement property. Furthermore, we demonstrate that mainstream backbone RL algorithms cannot simultaneously achieve both critic-free and convergence guarantees in multi-turn scenarios.
  To address this, we propose SeeUPO (Sequence-level Sequential Update Policy Optimization), a critic-free approach with convergence guarantees for multi-turn interactions. SeeUPO models multi-turn interaction as sequentially executed multi-agent bandit problems. Through turn-by-turn sequential policy updates in reverse execution order, it ensures monotonic improvement and convergence to global optimal solution via backward induction.
  Experiments on AppWorld and BFCL v4 demonstrate SeeUPO's substantial improvements over existing backbone algorithms: relative gains of 43.3%-54.6% on Qwen3-14B and 24.1%-41.9% on Qwen2.5-14B (averaged across benchmarks), along with superior training stability.

Abstract: The robustness of Vision Language Models (VLMs) is commonly assessed through output-level invariance, implicitly assuming that stable predictions reflect stable multimodal processing. In this work, we argue that this assumption is insufficient. We introduce a representation-aware and frequency-aware evaluation framework that measures internal embedding drift, spectral sensitivity, and structural smoothness (spatial consistency of vision tokens), alongside standard label-based metrics. Applying this framework to modern VLMs across the SEEDBench, MMMU, and POPE datasets reveals three distinct failure modes. First, models frequently preserve predicted answers while undergoing substantial internal representation drift; for perturbations such as text overlays, this drift approaches the magnitude of inter-image variability, indicating that representations move to regions typically occupied by unrelated inputs despite unchanged outputs. Second, robustness does not improve with scale; larger models achieve higher accuracy but exhibit equal or greater sensitivity, consistent with sharper yet more fragile decision boundaries. Third, we find that perturbations affect tasks differently: they harm reasoning when they disrupt how models combine coarse and fine visual cues, but on the hallucination benchmarks, they can reduce false positives by making models generate more conservative answers.

Abstract: Knowledge Graph (KG) generation requires models to learn complex semantic dependencies between triples while maintaining domain validity constraints. Unlike link prediction, which scores triples independently, generative models must capture interdependencies across entire subgraphs to produce semantically coherent structures. We present ARK (Auto-Regressive Knowledge Graph Generation), a family of autoregressive models that generate KGs by treating graphs as sequences of (head, relation, tail) triples. ARK learns implicit semantic constraints directly from data, including type consistency, temporal validity, and relational patterns, without explicit rule supervision. On the IntelliGraphs benchmark, our models achieve 89.2% to 100.0% semantic validity across diverse datasets while generating novel graphs not seen during training. We also introduce SAIL, a variational extension of ARK that enables controlled generation through learned latent representations, supporting both unconditional sampling and conditional completion from partial graphs. Our analysis reveals that model capacity (hidden dimensionality >= 64) is more critical than architectural depth for KG generation, with recurrent architectures achieving comparable validity to transformer-based alternatives while offering substantial computational efficiency. These results demonstrate that autoregressive models provide an effective framework for KG generation, with practical applications in knowledge base completion and query answering.

Abstract: We study multi-task reinforcement learning (RL), a setting in which an agent learns a single, universal policy capable of generalising to arbitrary, possibly unseen tasks. We consider tasks specified as linear temporal logic (LTL) formulae, which are commonly used in formal methods to specify properties of systems, and have recently been successfully adopted in RL. In this setting, we present a novel task embedding technique leveraging a new generation of semantic LTL-to-automata translations, originally developed for temporal synthesis. The resulting semantically labelled automata contain rich, structured information in each state that allow us to (i) compute the automaton efficiently on-the-fly, (ii) extract expressive task embeddings used to condition the policy, and (iii) naturally support full LTL. Experimental results in a variety of domains demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance and is able to scale to complex specifications where existing methods fail.

Abstract: Human concept learning is typically active: learners choose which instances to query or test in order to reduce uncertainty about an underlying rule or category. Active concept learning must balance informativeness of queries against the stability of the learner that generates and scores hypotheses. We study this trade-off in a neuro-symbolic Bayesian learner whose hypotheses are executable programs proposed by a large language model (LLM) and reweighted by Bayesian updating. We compare a Rational Active Learner that selects queries to maximize approximate expected information gain (EIG) and the human-like Positive Test Strategy (PTS) that queries instances predicted to be positive under the current best hypothesis. Across concept-learning tasks in the classic Number Game, EIG is effective when falsification is necessary (e.g., compound or exception-laden rules), but underperforms on simple concepts. We trace this failure to a support mismatch between the EIG policy and the LLM proposal distribution: highly diagnostic boundary queries drive the posterior toward regions where the generator produces invalid or overly specific programs, yielding a support-mismatch trap in the particle approximation. PTS is information-suboptimal but tends to maintain proposal validity by selecting "safe" queries, leading to faster convergence on simple rules. Our results suggest that "confirmation bias" may not be a cognitive error, but rather a rational adaptation for maintaining tractable inference in the sparse, open-ended hypothesis spaces characteristic of human thought.

Abstract: Training generalist agents capable of adapting to diverse scenarios requires interactive environments for self-exploration. However, interactive environments remain critically scarce, and existing synthesis methods suffer from significant limitations regarding environmental diversity and scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce ScaleEnv, a framework that constructs fully interactive environments and verifiable tasks entirely from scratch. Specifically, ScaleEnv ensures environment reliability through procedural testing, and guarantees task completeness and solvability via tool dependency graph expansion and executable action verification. By enabling agents to learn through exploration within ScaleEnv, we demonstrate significant performance improvements on unseen, multi-turn tool-use benchmarks such as $τ^2$-Bench and VitaBench, highlighting strong generalization capabilities. Furthermore, we investigate the relationship between increasing number of domains and model generalization performance, providing empirical evidence that scaling environmental diversity is critical for robust agent learning.

Abstract: Large foundation models (LFMs) achieve strong performance through scaling, yet current structural pruning methods derive fixed pruning decisions during inference, overlooking sparsity patterns that emerge in the autoregressive token generation. In this paper, we propose POP (Partition-guided Online Pruning), an efficient online structural pruning framework that enables context-conditioned dynamic pruning with minimal computational overhead. POP partitions model channels into retained, candidate, and pruned regions, where prefilling defines a coarse pruning partition, and the decoding stage generates a fine-grained mask within the candidate region, avoiding full-channel re-evaluation. The coarse pruning partition preserves consistently important weights, while the fine-grained masking provides context-conditioned variation during decoding. Moreover, POP is a lightweight, plug-and-play method that requires no preprocessing, including offline calibration, retraining, or learning predictors. Extensive evaluations across diverse LFMs, including large language models (LLMs), mixture-of-experts models (MoEs), and vision-language models (VLMs), demonstrate that POP consistently delivers higher accuracy than existing pruning approaches while incurring smaller computational overhead and minimizing inference latency.

Abstract: We develop a game-theoretic framework for predicting and steering the behavior of populations of large language models (LLMs) through Nash equilibrium (NE) analysis. To avoid the intractability of equilibrium computation in open-ended text spaces, we model each agent's action as a mixture over human subpopulations. Agents choose actively and strategically which groups to align with, yielding an interpretable and behaviorally substantive policy class. We derive closed-form NE characterizations, adopting standard concave-utility assumptions to enable analytical system-level predictions and give explicit, actionable guidance for shifting alignment targets toward socially desirable outcomes. The method functions as an active alignment layer on top of existing alignment pipelines such as RLHF. In a social-media setting, we show that a population of LLMs, especially reasoning-based models, may exhibit political exclusion, pathologies where some subpopulations are ignored by all LLM agents, which can be avoided by our method, illustrating the promise of applying the method to regulate multi-agent LLM dynamics across domains.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training across distributed clients while preserving data privacy. However, in practical deployments, device heterogeneity, non-independent, and identically distributed (Non-IID) data often lead to highly unstable and biased gradient updates. When differential privacy is enforced, conventional fixed gradient clipping and Gaussian noise injection may further amplify gradient perturbations, resulting in training oscillation and performance degradation and degraded model performance. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive differentially private federated learning framework that explicitly targets model efficiency under heterogeneous and privacy-constrained settings. On the client side, a lightweight local compressed module is introduced to regularize intermediate representations and constrain gradient variability, thereby mitigating noise amplification during local optimization. On the server side, an adaptive gradient clipping strategy dynamically adjusts clipping thresholds based on historical update statistics to avoid over-clipping and noise domination. Furthermore, a constraint-aware aggregation mechanism is designed to suppress unreliable or noise-dominated client updates and stabilize global optimization. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and SVHN demonstrate improved convergence stability and classification accuracy.

Abstract: Over the last decade, explainable AI has primarily focused on interpreting individual model predictions, producing post-hoc explanations that relate inputs to outputs under a fixed decision structure. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled agentic AI systems whose behaviour unfolds over multi-step trajectories. In these settings, success and failure are determined by sequences of decisions rather than a single output. While useful, it remains unclear how explanation approaches designed for static predictions translate to agentic settings where behaviour emerges over time. In this work, we bridge the gap between static and agentic explainability by comparing attribution-based explanations with trace-based diagnostics across both settings. To make this distinction explicit, we empirically compare attribution-based explanations used in static classification tasks with trace-based diagnostics used in agentic benchmarks (TAU-bench Airline and AssistantBench). Our results show that while attribution methods achieve stable feature rankings in static settings (Spearman $ρ= 0.86$), they cannot be applied reliably to diagnose execution-level failures in agentic trajectories. In contrast, trace-grounded rubric evaluation for agentic settings consistently localizes behaviour breakdowns and reveals that state tracking inconsistency is 2.7$\times$ more prevalent in failed runs and reduces success probability by 49\%. These findings motivate a shift towards trajectory-level explainability for agentic systems when evaluating and diagnosing autonomous AI behaviour.

Abstract: LLM agents hold significant promise for advancing scientific research. To accelerate this progress, we introduce AIRS-Bench (the AI Research Science Benchmark), a suite of 20 tasks sourced from state-of-the-art machine learning papers. These tasks span diverse domains, including language modeling, mathematics, bioinformatics, and time series forecasting. AIRS-Bench tasks assess agentic capabilities over the full research lifecycle -- including idea generation, experiment analysis and iterative refinement -- without providing baseline code. The AIRS-Bench task format is versatile, enabling easy integration of new tasks and rigorous comparison across different agentic frameworks. We establish baselines using frontier models paired with both sequential and parallel scaffolds. Our results show that agents exceed human SOTA in four tasks but fail to match it in sixteen others. Even when agents surpass human benchmarks, they do not reach the theoretical performance ceiling for the underlying tasks. These findings indicate that AIRS-Bench is far from saturated and offers substantial room for improvement. We open-source the AIRS-Bench task definitions and evaluation code to catalyze further development in autonomous scientific research.

All results exhibit agentic overconfidence: some agents that succeed only 22% of the time predict 77% success. Counterintuitively, pre-execution assessment with strictly less information tends to yield better discrimination than standard post-execution review, though differences are not always significant. Adversarial prompting reframing assessment as bug-finding achieves the best calibration.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong potential for Automated Program Repair (APR), yet most existing approaches remain unimodal and fail to leverage the rich diagnostic signals contained in visual artifacts such as screenshots and control-flow graphs. In practice, many bug reports convey critical information visually (e.g., layout breakage or missing widgets), but directly using such dense visual inputs often causes context loss and noise, making it difficult for MLLMs to ground visual observations into precise fault localization and executable patches. To bridge this semantic gap, we propose \textbf{SVRepair}, a multimodal APR framework with structured visual representation. SVRepair first fine-tunes a vision-language model, \textbf{Structured Visual Representation (SVR)}, to uniformly transform heterogeneous visual artifacts into a \emph{semantic scene graph} that captures GUI elements and their structural relations (e.g., hierarchy), providing normalized, code-relevant context for downstream repair. Building on the graph, SVRepair drives a coding agent to localize faults and synthesize patches, and further introduces an iterative visual-artifact segmentation strategy that progressively narrows the input to bug-centered regions to suppress irrelevant context and reduce hallucinations. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance: SVRepair achieves \textbf{36.47\%} accuracy on SWE-Bench M, \textbf{38.02\%} on MMCode, and \textbf{95.12\%} on CodeVision, validating the effectiveness of SVRepair for multimodal program repair.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Coding agents are increasingly utilized in test-driven software development, yet the theoretical mechanisms behind their environment-interaction strategies remain underexplored. We provide a probabilistic framework for two dominant paradigms: code selection after generation using the execution environment, and code generation conditioned on environment feedback. First, we formalize several well-established selection heuristics as environment-aware estimators of code correctness. We theoretically prove that estimators based on fuzzy functional similarity add an inductive bias and strictly dominate estimators based on functional equivalence in terms of signal-to-noise ratio. Second, we frame backprompting as an in-context approximation of Thompson sampling. We derive a novel regret bound for reward functions with unobservable components, theoretically explaining why the effectiveness of backprompting is limited by the ambiguity of the informal task description (an irreducible regret). Using three state-of-the-art open weight models, we corroborate these findings across BigCodeBenchHard, LeetCodeDataset, and QiskitHumanEvalSim. Our formalization also suggests how to improve task descriptions effectively, leading to a new benchmark, QiskitHumanEvalSimX.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Mobile applications in large-scale distributed systems are susceptible to backend service failures, yet traditional chaos engineering approaches cannot scale mobile testing due to the combinatorial explosion of flows, locations, and failure scenarios that need validation. We present an automated mobile chaos testing system that integrates DragonCrawl, an LLM-based mobile testing platform, with uHavoc, a service-level fault injection system. The key insight is that adaptive AI-driven test execution can navigate mobile applications under degraded backend conditions, eliminating the need to manually write test cases for each combination of user flow, city, and failure type. Since Q1 2024, our system has executed over 180,000 automated chaos tests across 47 critical flows in Uber's Rider, Driver, and Eats applications, representing approximately 39,000 hours of manual testing effort that would be impractical at this scale. We identified 23 resilience risks, with 70% being architectural dependency violations where non-critical service failures degraded core user flows. Twelve issues were severe enough to prevent trip requests or food orders. Two caused application crashes detectable only through mobile chaos testing, not backend testing alone. Automated root cause analysis reduced debugging time from hours to minutes, achieving 88% precision@5 in attributing mobile failures to specific backend services. This paper presents the system design, evaluates its performance under fault injection (maintaining 99% test reliability), and reports operational experience demonstrating that continuous mobile resilience validation is achievable at production scale.

Abstract: With the rapid rise of AI coding agents, the fundamental premise of what it means to be a software engineer is in question. In this vision paper, we re-examine what it means for an AI agent to be considered a software engineer and then critically think about what makes such an agent trustworthy. \textit{Grounded} in established definitions of software engineering (SE) and informed by recent research on agentic AI systems, we conceptualise AI software engineers as participants in human-AI SE teams composed of human software engineers and AI models and tools, and we distinguish trustworthiness as a key property of these systems and actors rather than a subjective human attitude. Based on historical perspectives and emerging visions, we identify key dimensions that contribute to the trustworthiness of AI software engineers, spanning technical quality, transparency and accountability, epistemic humility, and societal and ethical alignment. We further discuss how trustworthiness can be evaluated and demonstrated, highlighting a fundamental trust measurement gap: not everything that matters for trust can be easily measured. Finally, we outline implications for the design, evaluation, and governance of AI SE systems, advocating for an ethics-by-design approach to enable appropriate trust in future human-AI SE teams.

Abstract: Software development agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in automating tasks like environment setup, issue solving, and program repair. Unfortunately, understanding and debugging such agents remain challenging due to their complex and dynamic nature. Developers must reason about trajectories of LLM queries, tool calls, and code modifications, but current techniques reveal little of this intermediate process in a comprehensible format. The key insight of this paper is that debugging software development agents shares many similarities with conventional debugging of software programs, yet requires a higher level of abstraction that raises the level from low-level implementation details to high-level agent actions. Drawing on this insight, we introduce AgentStepper, the first interactive debugger for LLM-based software engineering agents. AgentStepper enables developers to inspect, control, and interactively manipulate agent trajectories. AgentStepper represents trajectories as structured conversations among an LLM, the agent program, and tools. It supports breakpoints, stepwise execution, and live editing of prompts and tool invocations, while capturing and displaying intermediate repository-level code changes. Our evaluation applies AgentStepper to three state-of-the-art software development agents, ExecutionAgent, SWE-Agent, and RepairAgent, showing that integrating the approach into existing agents requires minor code changes (39-42 edited lines). Moreover, we report on a user study with twelve participants, indicating that AgentStepper improves the ability of participants to interpret trajectories (64% vs. 67% mean performance) and identify bugs in the agent's implementation (17% vs. 60% success rate), while reducing perceived workload (e.g., frustration reduced from 5.4/7.0 to 2.4/7.0) compared to conventional tools.

Abstract: Summarizing source code into natural language descriptions (code summarization) helps developers better understand program functionality and reduce the burden of software maintenance. Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs), as opposed to source code, have been shown to improve summarization quality in traditional encoder-decoder-based code summarization models. However, most large language model (LLM)-based code summarization methods rely on raw code or only incorporate partial AST signals, meaning that the potential of complete AST representation has not been fully explored for LLMs. This paper presents AST(NIT), an AST augmentation and serialization method that preserves lexical details and encodes structural information into LLM-compatible sequences. Experiments with the LLaMA-3.1-8B model on the CodeXGLUE Python dataset show that the proposed serialized ASTs reduce the length of LLM inputs, require shorter training times, and achieve summarization quality comparable to existing approaches.

Abstract: CI/CD pipeline failure management is time-consuming when performed manually. Automating this process is non-trivial because the information required for effective failure management is unstructured and cannot be automatically processed by traditional programs. With their ability to process unstructured data, large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results for automated failure management by previous work. Following these studies, we evaluated whether an LLM-based system could automate failure management in a CI/CD pipeline in the context of a large industrial software project, namely SAP HANA. We evaluated the ability of the LLM-based system to identify the error location and to propose exact solutions that contain no unnecessary actions. To support the LLM in generating exact solutions, we provided it with different types of domain knowledge, including pipeline information, failure management instructions, and data from historical failures. We conducted an ablation study to determine which type of domain knowledge contributed most to solution accuracy. The results show that data from historical failures contributed the most to the system's accuracy, enabling it to produce exact solutions in 92.1% of cases in our dataset. The system correctly identified the error location with 97.4% accuracy when provided with domain knowledge, compared to 84.2% accuracy without it. In conclusion, our findings indicate that LLMs, when provided with data from historical failures, represent a promising approach for automating CI/CD pipeline failure management.

Abstract: Ensuring software quality in embedded firmware is critical, especially in safety-critical domains where compliance with functional safety standards (ISO 26262) requires strong guarantees of software reliability. While machine learning-based fault prediction models have demonstrated high accuracy, their lack of interpretability limits their adoption in industrial settings. Developers need actionable insights that can be directly employed in software quality assurance processes and guide defect mitigation strategies. In this paper, we present a structured process for defining context-specific software metric thresholds suitable for integration into fault detection workflows in industrial settings. Our approach supports cross-project fault prediction by deriving thresholds from one set of projects and applying them to independently developed firmware, thereby enabling reuse across similar software systems without retraining or domain-specific tuning. We analyze three real-world C-embedded firmware projects provided by an industrial partner, using Coverity and Understand static analysis tools to extract software metrics. Through statistical analysis and hypothesis testing, we identify discriminative metrics and derived empirical threshold values capable of distinguishing faulty from non-faulty functions. The derived thresholds are validated through an experimental evaluation, demonstrating their effectiveness in identifying fault-prone functions with high precision. The results confirm that the derived thresholds can serve as an interpretable solution for fault prediction, aligning with industry standards and SQA practices. This approach provides a practical alternative to black-box AI models, allowing developers to systematically assess software quality, take preventive actions, and integrate metric-based fault prediction into industrial development workflows to mitigate software faults.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate code with subtle but critical bugs, especially for complex tasks. Existing automated repair methods typically rely on superficial pass/fail signals, offering limited visibility into program behavior and hindering precise error localization. In addition, without a way to learn from prior failures, repair processes often fall into repetitive and inefficient cycles. To overcome these challenges, we present TraceCoder, a collaborative multi-agent framework that emulates the observe-analyze-repair process of human experts. The framework first instruments the code with diagnostic probes to capture fine-grained runtime traces, enabling deep insight into its internal execution. It then conducts causal analysis on these traces to accurately identify the root cause of the failure. This process is further enhanced by a novel Historical Lesson Learning Mechanism (HLLM), which distills insights from prior failed repair attempts to inform subsequent correction strategies and prevent recurrence of similar mistakes. To ensure stable convergence, a Rollback Mechanism enforces that each repair iteration constitutes a strict improvement toward the correct solution. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that TraceCoder achieves up to a 34.43\% relative improvement in Pass@1 accuracy over existing advanced baselines. Ablation studies verify the significance of each system component, with the iterative repair process alone contributing a 65.61\% relative gain in accuracy. Furthermore, TraceCoder significantly outperforms leading iterative methods in terms of both accuracy and cost-efficiency.
