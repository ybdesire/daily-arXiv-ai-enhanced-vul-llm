Currently, there is a paucity of evidence-based integrated treatments for CP and OUD among individuals receiving medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD). Wearable devices have the potential to monitor complex patient information and inform treatment development for persons with OUD and CP, including pain variability (e.g., exacerbations of pain or pain spikes) and clinical correlates (e.g., perceived stress). However, the application of large language models (LLMs) with wearable data for understanding pain spikes, remains unexplored. Consequently, the aim of this pilot study was to examine the clinical correlates of pain spikes using a range of AI approaches. We found that machine learning models achieved relatively high accuracy (>0.7) in predicting pain spikes, while LLMs were limited in providing insights on pain spikes. Real-time monitoring through wearable devices, combined with advanced AI models, could facilitate early detection of pain spikes and support personalized interventions that may help mitigate the risk of opioid relapse, improve adherence to MOUD, and enhance the integration of CP and OUD care. Given overall limited LLM performance, these findings highlight the need to develop LLMs which can provide actionable insights in the OUD/CP context.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u548cAI\u6280\u672f\u76d1\u6d4b\u6162\u6027\u75bc\u75db\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u75bc\u75db\u6ce2\u52a8\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u75bc\u75db\u5cf0\u503c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8f83\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6b64\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u6709\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u6162\u6027\u75bc\u75db\u548c\u963f\u7247\u7c7b\u836f\u7269\u4f7f\u7528\u969c\u788d\u5e38\u5e76\u5b58\u4e14\u76f8\u4e92\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9488\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u75be\u75c5\u7684\u6574\u5408\u6cbb\u7597\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u80fd\u591f\u76d1\u6d4b\u590d\u6742\u60a3\u8005\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46LLMs\u5728\u75bc\u75db\u6ce2\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5c1a\u65e0\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217AI\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u548cLLMs\uff09\u5206\u6790\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u75bc\u75db\u5cf0\u503c\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u75bc\u75db\u5cf0\u503c\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u9ad8\uff08>0.7\uff09\uff0c\u800cLLMs\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u75bc\u75db\u5cf0\u503c\u6d1e\u5bdf\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u6d4b\u7ed3\u5408\u5148\u8fdbAI\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u65e9\u671f\u53d1\u73b0\u75bc\u75db\u5cf0\u503c\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5e72\u9884\u3002\u7531\u4e8eLLMs\u6574\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u6b64\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u884c\u6d1e\u5bdf\u7684LLMs\u3002"}}

However, with the rapid growth of enterprise-scale MCP services, efficiently and accurately matching target functionalities among thousands of heterogeneous tools has become a core challenge restricting system practicality. Existing approaches generally rely on full-prompt injection or static semantic retrieval, facing issues including semantic disconnection between user queries and tool descriptions, context inflation in LLM input, and high inference latency. To address these challenges, this paper proposes Z-Space, a data-generation-oriented multi-agent collaborative tool invocation framework Z-Space. The Z-Space framework establishes a multi-agent collaborative architecture and tool filtering algorithm: (1) A structured semantic understanding of user queries is achieved through an intent parsing model; (2) A tool filtering module (FSWW) based on fused subspace weighted algorithm realizes fine-grained semantic alignment between intents and tools without parameter tuning; (3) An inference execution agent is constructed to support dynamic planning and fault-tolerant execution for multi-step tasks. This framework has been deployed in the Eleme platform's technical division, serving large-scale test data generation scenarios across multiple business units including Taotian, Gaode, and Hema. Production data demonstrates that the system reduces average token consumption in tool inference by 96.26\\% while achieving a 92\\% tool invocation accuracy rate, significantly enhancing the efficiency and reliability of intelligent test data generation systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Z-Space\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MCP\u670d\u52a1\u4e2d\u5de5\u5177\u5339\u914d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u51c6\u786e\u7387", "motivation": "\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7MCP\u670d\u52a1\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u5bfc\u81f4\u5f02\u6784\u5de5\u5177\u6570\u91cf\u6fc0\u589e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5168\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u6216\u9759\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u8131\u8282\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u81a8\u80c0\u548c\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7b49\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u67b6\u6784\uff1a1) \u610f\u56fe\u89e3\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\uff1b2) \u57fa\u4e8e\u878d\u5408\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u52a0\u6743\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b3) \u63a8\u7406\u6267\u884c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6b65\u9aa4\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u5bb9\u9519\u6267\u884c", "result": "\u5728\u997f\u4e86\u4e48\u6280\u672f\u90e8\u90e8\u7f72\u540e\uff0c\u5de5\u5177\u63a8\u7406\u5e73\u5747token\u6d88\u8017\u964d\u4f4e96.26%\uff0c\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u523092%", "conclusion": "Z-Space\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5de5\u5177\u5339\u914d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027"}}

We validate the library by demonstrating its ability to generate new research insights with minimal overhead, including depthwise representation probing and the analysis of CLIP degradation under synthetic data finetuning.

Safety alignment aims to suppress specific concepts, yet evaluations seldom test whether safety persists under benign downstream fine-tuning routinely applied after deployment (e.g., LoRA personalization, style/domain adapters). We study the stability of current safety methods under benign fine-tuning and observe frequent breakdowns. As true safety alignment must withstand even benign post-deployment adaptations, we introduce the SPQR benchmark (Safety-Prompt adherence-Quality-Robustness). SPQR is a single-scored metric that provides a standardized and reproducible framework to evaluate how well safety-aligned diffusion models preserve safety, utility, and robustness under benign fine-tuning, by reporting a single leaderboard score to facilitate comparisons. We conduct multilingual, domain-specific, and out-of-distribution analyses, along with category-wise breakdowns, to identify when safety alignment fails after benign fine-tuning, ultimately showcasing SPQR as a concise yet comprehensive benchmark for T2I safety alignment techniques for T2I models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SPQR\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6587\u751f\u56fe\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u826f\u6027\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ecf\u5e38\u5931\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f88\u5c11\u6d4b\u8bd5\u90e8\u7f72\u540e\u826f\u6027\u5fae\u8c03\uff08\u5982LoRA\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u3001\u98ce\u683c\u9002\u914d\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u6301\u4e45\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165SPQR\u57fa\u51c6\uff08\u5b89\u5168-\u63d0\u793a\u9075\u5faa-\u8d28\u91cf-\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u5206\u6790\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u524d\u5b89\u5168\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u826f\u6027\u5fae\u8c03\u4e0b\u9891\u7e41\u5931\u6548\uff0cSPQR\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u573a\u666f\u3002", "conclusion": "SPQR\u4e3a\u6587\u751f\u56fe\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7b80\u6d01\u800c\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Yet studies consistently show that a significant proportion of published workflows suffer from decay over time. This problem is particularly acute for legacy workflow systems like Taverna, where discontinued services, obsolete dependencies, and system retirement render previously functional workflows unusable. We present a novel legacy workflow migration system, called CodeR$^3$ (stands for Code Repair, Revival and Reuse), that leverages generative AI to analyze the characteristics of decayed workflows, reproduce them into modern workflow technologies like Snakemake and VisFlow. Our system additionally integrates stepwise workflow analysis visualization, automated service substitution, and human-in-the-loop validation. Through several case studies of Taverna workflow revival, we demonstrate the feasibility of this approach while identifying key challenges that require human oversight. Our findings reveal that automation significantly reduces manual effort in workflow parsing and service identification. However, critical tasks such as service substitution and data validation still require domain expertise. Our result will be a crowdsourcing platform that enables the community to collaboratively revive decayed workflows and validate the functionality and correctness of revived workflows.

Traditional human alignment reviews are accurate but slow and labor-intensive, especially across large item banks. This study examines whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can accelerate this process without sacrificing accuracy. Using over 12,000 item-skill pairs in grades K-5, we tested three LLMs (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-4o) across three tasks that mirror real-world challenges: identifying misaligned items, selecting the correct skill from the full set of standards, and narrowing candidate lists prior to classification. In Study 1, GPT-4o-mini correctly identified alignment status in approximately 83-94% of cases, including subtle misalignments. In Study 2, performance remained strong in mathematics but was lower for reading, where standards are more semantically overlapping. Study 3 demonstrated that pre-filtering candidate skills substantially improved results, with the correct skill appearing among the top five suggestions more than 95% of the time. These findings suggest that LLMs, particularly when paired with candidate filtering strategies, can significantly reduce the manual burden of item review while preserving alignment accuracy.

Results indicate that full fine-tuning achieves the highest overall scores, with BLEU and ROUGE improvements of up to 10% over LoRA variants.

We introduce CODEFUSE-COMMITEVAL, the first benchmark designed for MCI detection using large language models (LLMs). Built on the ApacheCM dataset for diversity and quality, we generate seven types of inconsistent messages through rule-guided mutations of originally consistent commits and apply two-fold validation to verify both positive and negative samples. Using this labeled dataset of message-diff pairs, we evaluate six state-of-the-art open-source LLMs under a vanilla setting and with three augmentation strategies: few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought, and extended context. Results show models detect inconsistent commits more reliably than consistent ones (average Recall 85.95%, Precision 80.28%, Specificity 63.8%); gpt-oss-20B performs best overall but uses over twice the tokens of others. Augmentation effects vary: adjacent context helps larger models but adds noise for smaller ones; few-shot improves accuracy and reduces token use, yet increases universally incorrect predictions; chain-of-thought boosts precision and specificity at the cost of recall and higher token consumption. Type-wise analysis reveals higher detectability for component, file-path, and operation inconsistencies, but lower accuracy and higher token cost for intent-level \"purpose\" inconsistencies.

The C programming language, prevalent in CPS development, is crucial for system control where reliability is critical. However, it is also commonly susceptible to vulnerabilities, particularly buffer overflows. Traditional vulnerability discovery techniques often struggle with scalability and precision when applied directly to the binary code of C programs, which can thereby keep programs vulnerable. This work introduces a novel approach designed to overcome these limitations by leveraging model checking and concolic execution techniques to automatically verify security properties of a program's stack memory in binary code, trampoline techniques to perform automated repair of the issues, and crash-inducing inputs to verify if they were successfully removed. The approach constructs a Memory State Space - MemStaCe- from the binary program's control flow graph and simulations, provided by concolic execution, of C function calls and loop constructs. The security properties, defined in LTL, model the correct behaviour of functions associated with vulnerabilities and allow the approach to identify vulnerabilities in MemStaCe by analysing counterexample traces that are generated when a security property is violated.

While personalized multidisciplinary interventions have the potential to slow disease progression and enhance quality of life, they typically require substantial medical resources and expertise, making them difficult to implement in resource-limited settings. To address this challenge, we developed KOM, a multi-agent system designed to automate KOA evaluation, risk prediction, and treatment prescription. This system assists clinicians in performing essential tasks across the KOA care pathway and supports the generation of tailored management plans based on individual patient profiles, disease status, risk factors, and contraindications. In benchmark experiments, KOM demonstrated superior performance compared to several general-purpose large language models in imaging analysis and prescription generation. A randomized three-arm simulation study further revealed that collaboration between KOM and clinicians reduced total diagnostic and planning time by 38.5% and resulted in improved treatment quality compared to each approach used independently. These findings indicate that KOM could help facilitate automated KOA management and, when integrated into clinical workflows, has the potential to enhance care efficiency.

MPC-based ML allows multiple parties to collaboratively run an ML workload without sharing their private data or model parameters using multi-party computing (MPC). Because MPC cannot natively run ML operations such as Softmax or GELU, existing frameworks use different approximations. Our study shows that, on a well-optimized framework, these approximations often become the dominating bottleneck. Popular approximations are often insufficiently accurate or unnecessarily slow, and these issues are hard to identify and fix in existing frameworks. To tackle this issue, we propose a compiler for MPC-based ML, CrypTorch. CrypTorch disentangles these approximations with the rest of the MPC runtime, allows easily adding new approximations through its programming interface, and automatically selects approximations to maximize both performance and accuracy.

Existing query-dependent approaches rely on unstable textual feedback or black-box reward models, providing weak and uninterpretable optimization signals. More fundamentally, prompt quality itself lacks a unified, systematic definition, resulting in fragmented and unreliable evaluation signals. Our approach first establishes a performance-oriented, systematic, and comprehensive prompt evaluation framework. Furthermore, we develop and finetune an execution-free evaluator that predicts multi-dimensional quality scores directly from text. The evaluator then instructs a metric-aware optimizer that diagnoses failure modes and rewrites prompts in an interpretable, query-dependent manner. Our evaluator achieves the strongest accuracy in predicting prompt performance, and the evaluation-instructed optimization consistently surpass both static-template and query-dependent baselines across eight datasets and on three backbone models.

We present Prompt Fencing, a novel architectural approach that applies cryptographic authentication and data architecture principles to establish explicit security boundaries within LLM prompts. Our approach decorates prompt segments with cryptographically signed metadata including trust ratings and content types, enabling LLMs to distinguish between trusted instructions and untrusted content. While current LLMs lack native fence awareness, we demonstrate that simulated awareness through prompt instructions achieved complete prevention of injection attacks in our experiments, reducing success rates from 86.7% (260/300 successful attacks) to 0% (0/300 successful attacks) across 300 test cases with two leading LLM providers. We implement a proof-of-concept fence generation and verification pipeline with a total overhead of 0.224 seconds (0.130s for fence generation, 0.094s for validation) across 100 samples.

Even still, measuring performance by a single scalar (be it reward or satisfaction probability) masks safety-performance trade-offs that arise in settings with a tolerable level of risk.\n  We address both limitations simultaneously by combining $\u03c9$-regular objectives with explicit constraints, allowing safety requirements and optimisation targets to be treated separately. We develop a model-based RL algorithm based on linear programming, which in the limit produces a policy maximising the probability of satisfying an $\u03c9$-regular objective while also adhering to $\u03c9$-regular constraints within specified thresholds.

This paper introduces MicroSims a novel framework for creating lightweight, interactive educational simulations that can be rapidly generated using artificial intelligence, universally embedded across digital learning platforms, and easily customized without programming knowledge. MicroSims occupy a unique position at the intersection of three key innovations: (1) standardized design patterns that enable AI-assisted generation, (2) iframe-based architecture that provides universal embedding and sandboxed security, and (3) transparent, modifiable code that supports customization and pedagogical transparency. We present a comprehensive framework encompassing design principles, technical architecture, metadata standards, and development workflows. Drawing on empirical research from physics education studies and meta-analyses across STEM disciplines, we demonstrate that interactive simulations can improve conceptual understanding by up to 30-40\\% compared to traditional instruction. MicroSims extend these benefits while addressing persistent barriers of cost, technical complexity, and platform dependence. This work has significant implications for educational equity, and low-cost intelligent interactive textbooks that enabling educators worldwide to create customized, curriculum-aligned simulations on demand.

We adapted the 10-item General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES) to elicit simulated self-assessments from ten LLMs across four conditions: no task, computational reasoning, social reasoning, and summarization. GSES responses were highly stable across repeated administrations and randomized item orders. However, models showed significantly different self-efficacy levels across conditions, with aggregate scores lower than human norms. All models achieved perfect accuracy on computational and social questions, whereas summarization performance varied widely. Self-assessment did not reliably reflect ability: several low-scoring models performed accurately, while some high-scoring models produced weaker summaries.

However, due to the difficulty in effectively evaluating intermediate algorithmic steps and the inability to locate and timely correct erroneous steps, these methods often generate incorrect code and incur increased computational costs. To tackle these problems, we propose RPM-MCTS, an effective method that utilizes Knowledge-Retrieval as Process Reward Model based on Monte Carlo Tree Search to evaluate intermediate algorithmic steps. By utilizing knowledge base retrieval, RPM-MCTS avoids the complex training of process reward models. During the expansion phase, similarity filtering is employed to remove redundant nodes, ensuring diversity in reasoning paths. Furthermore, our method utilizes sandbox execution feedback to locate erroneous algorithmic steps during generation, enabling timely and targeted corrections. Extensive experiments on four public code generation benchmarks demonstrate that RPM-MCTS outperforms current state-of-the-art methods while achieving an approximately 15% reduction in token consumption.

You are using WhatsApp: Enumerating Three Billion Accounts for Security and Privacy", "comment": "Accepted to NDSS2026, Artifacts available at https://github.com/sbaresearch/whatsapp-census", "summary": "WhatsApp, with 3.5 billion active accounts as of early 2025, is the world's largest instant messaging platform. Given its massive user base, WhatsApp plays a critical role in global communication.\n  To initiate conversations, users must first discover whether their contacts are registered on the platform. This is achieved by querying WhatsApp's servers with mobile phone numbers extracted from the user's address book (if they allowed access). This architecture inherently enables phone number enumeration, as the service must allow legitimate users to query contact availability. While rate limiting is a standard defense against abuse, we revisit the problem and show that WhatsApp remains highly vulnerable to enumeration at scale. In our study, we were able to probe over a hundred million phone numbers per hour without encountering blocking or effective rate limiting.\n  Our findings demonstrate not only the persistence but the severity of this vulnerability. We further show that nearly half of the phone numbers disclosed in the 2021 Facebook data leak are still active on WhatsApp, underlining the enduring risks associated with such exposures.

However, there is evidence that current semantic similarity methods may capture syntactic or lexical forms over semantic content. While benchmarks exist for semantic equivalence, they often suffer from high generation costs due to reliance on subjective human judgment, limited availability for domain-specific applications, and unclear definitions of equivalence. This paper introduces a novel method for generating benchmarks to evaluate semantic similarity methods for LLM outputs, specifically addressing these limitations. Our approach leverages knowledge graphs (KGs) to generate pairs of natural-language statements that are semantically similar or dissimilar, with dissimilar pairs categorized into one of four sub-types. We generate benchmark datasets in four different domains (general knowledge, biomedicine, finance, biology), and conduct a comparative study of semantic similarity methods including traditional natural language processing scores and LLM-as-a-judge predictions. We observe that the sub-type of semantic variation, as well as the domain of the benchmark impact the performance of semantic similarity methods, with no method being consistently superior. Our results present important implications for the use of LLM-as-a-judge in detecting the semantic content of text.

Typically, these decisions are made by users during app installation or at runtime. Due to the increasing complexity and automation of systems, making these access control decisions can add a significant cognitive load on users, often overloading them and leading to suboptimal or even arbitrary access control decisions. To address this problem, we propose to leverage the processing and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to make dynamic, context-aware decisions aligned with the user's security preferences. For this purpose, we conducted a user study, which resulted in a dataset of 307 natural-language privacy statements and 14,682 access control decisions made by users. We then compare these decisions against those made by two versions of LLMs: a general and a personalized one, for which we also gathered user feedback on 1,446 of its decisions.\n  Our results show that in general, LLMs can reflect users' preferences well, achieving up to 86\\% accuracy when compared to the decision made by the majority of users. Our study also reveals a crucial trade-off in personalizing such a system: while providing user-specific privacy preferences to the LLM generally improves agreement with individual user decisions, adhering to those preferences can also violate some security best practices.

Using this taxonomy, we analyze the growing gap in evaluation and monitoring practices: existing benchmarks measure knowledge or reasoning but provide little insight into stability, reproducibility, drift, or workflow integration. We further examine the production challenges associated with deploying LLMs - including observability limitations, cost constraints, and update-induced regressions - and outline high-level design principles for building reliable, maintainable, and cost-aware LLM systems.

A fundamental challenge in this paradigm lies in the modality gap--the structural and semantic disconnect between provenance graphs and CTI reports. Prior work addresses this by framing threat hunting as a graph matching task: 1) extracting attack graphs from CTI reports, and 2) aligning them with provenance graphs. However, this pipeline incurs severe \\textit{information loss} during graph extraction and demands intensive manual curation, undermining scalability and effectiveness.\n  In this paper, we present APT-CGLP, a novel cross-modal APT hunting system via Contrastive Graph-Language Pre-training, facilitating end-to-end semantic matching between provenance graphs and CTI reports without human intervention. First, empowered by the Large Language Model (LLM), APT-CGLP mitigates data scarcity by synthesizing high-fidelity provenance graph-CTI report pairs, while simultaneously distilling actionable insights from noisy web-sourced CTIs to improve their operational utility. Second, APT-CGLP incorporates a tailored multi-objective training algorithm that synergizes contrastive learning with inter-modal masked modeling, promoting cross-modal attack semantic alignment at both coarse- and fine-grained levels.

Despite impressive performance, existing multi-agent systems inherently incur substantial token overhead and increased computational costs, posing challenges for large-scale deployment. To address these issues, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Multi-agent hierarchical communication graph PRUNING framework, termed M$^3$Prune. Our framework eliminates redundant edges across different modalities, achieving an optimal balance between task performance and token overhead. Specifically, M$^3$Prune first applies intra-modal graph sparsification to textual and visual modalities, identifying the edges most critical for solving the task. Subsequently, we construct a dynamic communication topology using these key edges for inter-modal graph sparsification. Finally, we progressively prune redundant edges to obtain a more efficient and hierarchical topology.

Experiments on multiple remote sensing benchmarks demonstrate that VICoT significantly outperforms existing SOTA frameworks in reasoning transparency, execution efficiency, and generation quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86VICoT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u5de5\u5177\u4e0e\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u7ec7\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u8f6e\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u6b63\u4ece\u7b80\u5355\u7269\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u8f6c\u5411\u590d\u6742\u667a\u80fd\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6808\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6a21\u5757\u5316MCP\u517c\u5bb9\u5de5\u5177\u5957\u4ef6\uff0c\u4f7f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u6267\u884c\u591a\u8f6e\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u4ea4\u7ec7\u63a8\u7406\uff1b\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u63a8\u7406\u6808\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u590d\u6742Agent\u884c\u4e3a\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u8f7b\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9065\u611f\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\uff0cVICoT\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3001\u6267\u884c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "VICoT\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u6574\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u5de5\u5177\u5230\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u9065\u611f\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u84b8\u998f\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

Second, in the GPU Track, we further adopt GRPO training, replacing supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement learning directly optimized by reward signals.

However, despite their versatility, current training paradigms for model weight optimization methods, like PPO and GRPO, remain relatively impractical with their high computational overhead for rollout convergence. In addition, the resulting agent policies are difficult to interpret, adapt, or incrementally improve. To address this, we investigate creating and refining structured memory of experiential learning of an agent from its environment as an alternative route to agent optimization. We introduce BREW (Bootstrapping expeRientially-learned Environmental knoWledge), a framework for agent optimization for downstream tasks via KB construction and refinement. In our formulation, we introduce an effective method for partitioning agent memory for more efficient retrieval and refinement. BREW uses task graders and behavior rubrics to learn insights while leveraging state-space search for ensuring robustness from the noise and non-specificity in natural language. Empirical results on real world, domain-grounded benchmarks -- OSWorld, $\u03c4^2$Bench, and SpreadsheetBench -- show BREW achieves $10-20\\%$ improvement in task precision, $10-15\\%$ reduction in API/tool calls leading to faster execution time, all while maintaining computational efficiency on par with base models. Unlike prior work where memory is treated as static context, we establish the KB as a modular and controllable substrate for agent optimization -- an explicit lever for shaping behavior in a transparent, interpretable, and extensible manner.", "AI": {"tldr": "BREW\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u6765\u4f18\u5316LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u91cd\u91cf\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4f18\u5316LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982PPO\u548cGRPO\uff09\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u4e14\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86BREW\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u51c6\u5219\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5b66\u4e60\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u641c\u7d22\u786e\u4fdd\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cBREW\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u534710-20%\uff0cAPI/\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u51cf\u5c1110-15%\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u66f4\u77ed\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "BREW\u786e\u7acb\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u57fa\u677f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u900f\u660e\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5851\u9020\u3002"}}

However, existing multimodal learning frameworks, focused on vision and language, lack physical consistency and overlook the intrinsic causal relationships among an object's geometry, material, vibration modes, and the sounds it produces. We introduce VibraVerse, a large-scale geometry-acoustics alignment dataset that explicitly bridges the causal chain from 3D geometry -> physical attributes -> modal parameters -> acoustic signals. Each 3D model has explicit physical properties (density, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio) and volumetric geometry, from which modal eigenfrequencies and eigenvectors are computed for impact sound synthesis under controlled excitations. To establish this coherence, we introduce CLASP, a contrastive learning framework for cross-modal alignment that preserves the causal correspondence between an object's physical structure and its acoustic response. This framework enforces physically consistent alignment across modalities, ensuring that every sample is coherent, traceable to the governing equations, and embedded within a unified representation space spanning shape, image, and sound. Built upon VibraVerse, we define a suite of benchmark tasks for geometry-to-sound prediction, sound-guided shape reconstruction, and cross-modal representation learning. Extensive validations on these tasks demonstrate that models trained on VibraVerse exhibit superior accuracy, interpretability, and generalization across modalities. These results establish VibraVerse as a benchmark for physically consistent and causally interpretable multimodal learning, providing a foundation for sound-guided embodied perception and a deeper understanding of the physical world. The dataset will be open-sourced.", "AI": {"tldr": "VibraVerse\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u54083D\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u58f0\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u94fe\u5efa\u6a21\u5b9e\u73b0\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u7269\u4f53\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u6750\u6599\u5c5e\u6027\u4e0e\u4ea7\u751f\u58f0\u97f3\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5185\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb", "method": "\u6784\u5efaVibraVerse\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b3D\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u7269\u7406\u5c5e\u6027\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u5408\u6210\u58f0\u5b66\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1CLASP\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8eVibraVerse\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b", "conclusion": "VibraVerse\u4e3a\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4e3a\u58f0\u97f3\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5177\u8eab\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840"}}
