Although Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate software development, most studies focus on isolated, single-agent function-level generation. This work examines how process structure and role specialization shape multi-agent LLM workflows for class-level code generation. We simulate a Waterfall-style development cycle covering Requirement, Design, Implementation, and Testing using three LLMs (GPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-Chat, and Claude-3.5-Haiku) on 100 Python tasks from the ClassEval benchmark. Our findings show that multi-agent workflows reorganize, rather than consistently enhance, model performance. Waterfall-style collaboration produces cleaner and more maintainable code but often reduces functional correctness (-37.8\\% for GPT-4o-mini and -39.8\\% for DeepSeek-Chat), with Claude-3.5-Haiku as a notable exception (+9.5\\%). Importantly, process constraints shift failure characteristics: structural issues such as missing code decrease, while semantic and validation errors become more frequent. Among all stages, Testing exerts the strongest influence by improving verification coverage but also introducing new reasoning failures, whereas Requirement and Design have comparatively modest effects. Overall, this study provides empirical evidence that software process structure fundamentally alters how LLMs reason, collaborate, and fail, revealing inherent trade-offs between rigid workflow discipline and flexible problem-solving in multi-agent code generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53LLM\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e2d\u6d41\u7a0b\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u89d2\u8272\u4e13\u95e8\u5316\u5bf9\u7c7b\u7ea7\u522b\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u7011\u5e03\u5f0f\u5f00\u53d1\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u7ef4\u62a4\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u4f46\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u51fd\u6570\u7ea7\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u4ee3\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u3001\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53LLM\u5728\u7c7b\u7ea7\u522b\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u79cdLLM\uff08GPT-4o-mini\u3001DeepSeek-Chat\u3001Claude-3.5-Haiku\uff09\u5728ClassEval\u57fa\u51c6\u7684100\u4e2aPython\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6a21\u62df\u7011\u5e03\u5f0f\u5f00\u53d1\u5468\u671f\uff08\u9700\u6c42\u3001\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u5b9e\u73b0\u3001\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u91cd\u7ec4\u800c\u975e\u4e00\u81f4\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff1a\u7011\u5e03\u5f0f\u534f\u4f5c\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u3001\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u4f46\u666e\u904d\u964d\u4f4e\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff08GPT-4o-mini\u4e0b\u964d37.8%\uff0cDeepSeek-Chat\u4e0b\u964d39.8%\uff09\uff0cClaude-3.5-Haiku\u4f8b\u5916\uff08\u63d0\u53479.5%\uff09\u3002\u6d41\u7a0b\u7ea6\u675f\u6539\u53d8\u9519\u8bef\u7279\u5f81\uff1a\u7ed3\u6784\u95ee\u9898\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9519\u8bef\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9636\u6bb5\u5f71\u54cd\u6700\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6d41\u7a0b\u7ed3\u6784\u4ece\u6839\u672c\u4e0a\u6539\u53d8LLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u534f\u4f5c\u548c\u5931\u8d25\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u4e25\u683c\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7eaa\u5f8b\u4e0e\u7075\u6d3b\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5185\u5728\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

However, while these models often generate functionally correct outputs, we still lack a systematic understanding and evaluation of their non-functional qualities. Existing studies focus mainly on whether generated code passes the tests rather than whether it passes with quality. Guided by the ISO/IEC 25010 quality model, this study conducted three complementary investigations: a systematic review of 108 papers, two industry workshops with practitioners from multiple organizations, and an empirical analysis of patching real-world software issues using three LLMs. Motivated by insights from both the literature and practitioners, the empirical study examined the quality of generated patches on security, maintainability, and performance efficiency. Across the literature, we found that security and performance efficiency dominate academic attention, while maintainability and other qualities are understudied. In contrast, industry experts prioritize maintainability and readability, warning that generated code may accelerate the accumulation of technical debt. In our evaluation of functionally correct patches generated by three LLMs, improvements in one quality dimension often come at the cost of others. Runtime and memory results further show high variance across models and optimization strategies.

This overload of alerts leads to ``alert fatigue'', a phenomenon where developers become desensitized to warnings, potentially overlooking critical issues and ultimately hindering productivity and code quality. Analyzing these warnings and training machine learning models to identify and filter them requires substantial datasets, which are currently scarce, particularly for Java. This scarcity impedes efforts to improve the accuracy and usability of SCA tools and mitigate the effects of alert fatigue. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a novel methodology for collecting and categorizing SCA warnings, effectively distinguishing actionable from non-actionable ones. We further leverage this methodology to generate a large-scale dataset of over 1 million entries of Java source code warnings, named NASCAR: (Non-)Actionable Static Code Analysis Reports.

However, experimental observations reveal that these structures remain prone to mechanical failure, with shell fractures and core-shell debonding occurring after a single charge. In this work, we present a novel, comprehensive computational framework to predict and gain insight into the failure of core-shell morphologies and the associated degradation in battery performance. The fully coupled chemo-mechano-damage model presented captures the interplay between mechanical damage and electrochemical behaviours, enabling the quantification of particle cracking and capacity fade. Both bulk material fracture and interface debonding are captured by utilising the phase field method. We quantify the severity of particle cracking and capacity loss through case studies on a representative core-shell system (NMC811@NMC532). The results bring valuable insights into cracking patterns, underlying mechanisms, and their impact on capacity loss. Surface cracks are found to initiate when a significantly higher lithium concentration accumulates in the core compared to the shell. Interfacial debonding is shown to arise from localised hoop stresses near the core-shell interface, due to greater shell expansion. This debonding develops rapidly, impedes lithium-ion transport, and can lead to more than 10\\% capacity loss after a single discharge. Furthermore, larger particles may experience crack branching driven by extensive tensile zones, potentially fragmenting the entire particle. The framework developed can not only bring new insight into the degradation mechanisms of core-shell particles but also be used to design electrode materials with improved performance and extended lifetime.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\u9884\u6d4b\u6838\u58f3\u7535\u6781\u9897\u7c92\u7684\u673a\u68b0\u5931\u6548\uff08\u5f00\u88c2\u548c\u8131\u7c98\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u9502\u7535\u6c60\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u573a\u6cd5\u6a21\u62df\u53d1\u73b0\u754c\u9762\u5e94\u529b\u5bfc\u81f4\u5feb\u901f\u8131\u7c98\u548c\u8d85\u8fc710%\u5bb9\u91cf\u635f\u5931\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6838\u58f3\u7535\u6781\u9897\u7c92\u662f\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u9502\u79bb\u5b50\u7535\u6c60\u7684\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9a8c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u5355\u6b21\u5145\u7535\u540e\u6613\u53d1\u751f\u673a\u68b0\u5931\u6548\uff08\u58f3\u7834\u88c2\u548c\u6838\u58f3\u8131\u7c98\uff09\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u5931\u6548\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u5168\u8026\u5408\u7684\u5316\u5b66-\u673a\u68b0-\u635f\u4f24\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u76f8\u573a\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u673a\u68b0\u635f\u4f24\u4e0e\u7535\u5316\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u9897\u7c92\u5f00\u88c2\u548c\u5bb9\u91cf\u8870\u51cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728NMC811@NMC532\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u8868\u9762\u88c2\u7eb9\u7531\u6838\u5185\u9502\u6d53\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8e\u58f3\u5c42\u5f15\u53d1\uff1b\u754c\u9762\u8131\u7c98\u6e90\u4e8e\u58f3\u5c42\u81a8\u80c0\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u73af\u5411\u5e94\u529b\uff0c\u5feb\u901f\u8131\u7c98\u963b\u788d\u9502\u79bb\u5b50\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u5355\u6b21\u653e\u7535\u53ef\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d85\u8fc710%\u5bb9\u91cf\u635f\u5931\uff1b\u5927\u9897\u7c92\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u88c2\u7eb9\u5206\u679d\u5bfc\u81f4\u6574\u4f53\u7834\u788e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u6838\u58f3\u9897\u7c92\u964d\u89e3\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u4f18\u3001\u5bff\u547d\u66f4\u957f\u7684\u7535\u6781\u6750\u6599\u3002"}}

However, LLMs' effectiveness for phishing detection remains unexplored. This study investigates how to effectively leverage LLMs for phishing detection (including target brand identification) by examining the impact of input modalities (screenshots, logos, HTML, and URLs), temperature settings, and prompt engineering strategies. Using a dataset of 19,131 real-world phishing websites and 243 benign sites, we evaluate seven LLMs -- two commercial models (GPT 4.1 and Gemini 2.0 flash) and five open-source models (Qwen, Llama, Janus, DeepSeek-VL2, and R1) -- alongside two deep learning (DL)-based baselines (PhishIntention and Phishpedia).\n  Our findings reveal that commercial LLMs generally outperform open-source models in phishing detection, while DL models demonstrate better performance on benign samples. For brand identification, screenshot inputs achieve optimal results, with commercial LLMs reaching 93-95% accuracy and open-source models, particularly Qwen, achieving up to 92%.

However, this surge raises significant privacy concerns, as sensitive patterns can reveal personal details. While traditional differential privacy (DP) relies on trusted servers, local differential privacy (LDP) enables users to perturb their own data. However, traditional LDP methods perturb time series data by adding user-specific noise but exhibit vulnerabilities. For instance, noise applied within fixed time windows can be canceled during aggregation (e.g., averaging), enabling adversaries to infer individual statistics over time, thereby eroding privacy guarantees.\n  To address these issues, we introduce a Cooperative Local Differential Privacy (CLDP) mechanism that enhances privacy by distributing noise vectors across multiple users. In our approach, noise is collaboratively generated and assigned so that when all users' perturbed data is aggregated, the noise cancels out preserving overall statistical properties while protecting individual privacy. This cooperative strategy not only counters vulnerabilities inherent in time-window-based methods but also scales effectively for large, real-time datasets, striking a better balance between data utility and privacy in multiuser environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u534f\u4f5c\u5f0f\u5c40\u90e8\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u7528\u6237\u4e4b\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u566a\u58f0\u5411\u91cf\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002", "motivation": "\u667a\u80fd\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\u5bfc\u81f4\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u7206\u70b8\u5f0f\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u5c40\u90e8\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u566a\u58f0\u5728\u805a\u5408\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u62b5\u6d88\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u534f\u4f5c\u5f0f\u5c40\u90e8\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4e2a\u7528\u6237\u534f\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5206\u914d\u566a\u58f0\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5728\u805a\u5408\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u566a\u58f0\u76f8\u4e92\u62b5\u6d88\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5bf9\u6297\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u53e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e2a\u4f53\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6574\u4f53\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u534f\u4f5c\u5f0f\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u591a\u7528\u6237\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7528\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4e4b\u95f4\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u65f6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002"}}

To foster user trust and comply with emerging regulatory frameworks, the Explainable AI (XAI) methods, particularly post-hoc techniques such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), are widely employed to elucidate model behavior. However, recent studies have shown that these explanation methods can inadvertently expose sensitive user attributes and behavioral patterns, thereby introducing new privacy risks. To address these concerns, we propose a novel privacy-preserving approach based on SHAP entropy regularization to mitigate privacy leakage in explainable AIoT applications. Our method incorporates an entropy-based regularization objective that penalizes low-entropy SHAP attribution distributions during training, promoting a more uniform spread of feature contributions. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we developed a suite of SHAP-based privacy attacks that strategically leverage model explanation outputs to infer sensitive information. We validate our method through comparative evaluations using these attacks alongside utility metrics on benchmark smart home energy consumption datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that SHAP entropy regularization substantially reduces privacy leakage compared to baseline models, while maintaining high predictive accuracy and faithful explanation fidelity.

Although DD is often assumed to enhance data privacy by aggregating over individual examples, recent studies reveal that standard DD can still leak sensitive information from the original dataset due to the lack of formal privacy guarantees. Existing differentially private (DP)-DD methods attempt to mitigate this risk by injecting noise into the distillation process. However, they often fail to fully leverage the original dataset, resulting in degraded realism and utility. This paper introduces \\libn, a novel framework that addresses the key limitations of current DP-DD by leveraging DP-generated data. Specifically, \\lib initializes the distilled dataset with DP-generated data to enhance realism.

While developers are ultimately responsible for validating and reviewing such outputs, improving the inherent quality of these generated code snippets remains essential. A key contributing factor to insecure outputs is the presence of vulnerabilities in the training datasets used to build large language models (LLMs). To address this issue, we propose curating training data to include only code that is free from detectable vulnerabilities. In this study, we constructed a secure dataset by filtering an existing Python corpus using a static analysis tool to retain only vulnerability-free functions. We then trained two transformer-based models: one on the curated dataset and one on the original, unfiltered dataset. The models were evaluated on both the correctness and security of the code they generated in response to natural language function descriptions. Our results show that the model trained on the curated dataset produced outputs with fewer security issues, while maintaining comparable functional correctness.

However, this can create a false sense of security. Despite not sharing private data increases the overall privacy, prior studies have shown that gradients exchanged during the FL training remain vulnerable to Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIAs). These attacks allow reconstructing the clients' local data, breaking the privacy promise of FL. GIAs can be launched by either a passive or an active server. In the latter case, a malicious server manipulates the global model to facilitate data reconstruction. While effective, earlier attacks falling under this category have been demonstrated to be detectable by clients, limiting their real-world applicability. Recently, novel active GIAs have emerged, claiming to be far stealthier than previous approaches. This work provides the first comprehensive analysis of these claims, investigating four state-of-the-art GIAs. We propose novel lightweight client-side detection techniques, based on statistically improbable weight structures and anomalous loss and gradient dynamics. Extensive evaluation across several configurations demonstrates that our methods enable clients to effectively detect active GIAs without any modifications to the FL training protocol.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u53cd\u6f14\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u65b0\u578b\u4e3b\u52a8\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9690\u853d\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u867d\u7136\u4e0d\u5171\u4eab\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u4ea4\u6362\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u65b0\u578b\u4e3b\u52a8\u68af\u5ea6\u53cd\u6f14\u653b\u51fb\u58f0\u79f0\u66f4\u9690\u853d\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7edf\u8ba1\u5f02\u5e38\u6743\u91cd\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u635f\u5931/\u68af\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e3b\u52a8\u68af\u5ea6\u53cd\u6f14\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73b0\u6709\"\u9690\u853d\"\u653b\u51fb\u4ecd\u53ef\u88ab\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u9632\u5fa1\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\uff0c\u6253\u7834\u4e86\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u5173\u4e8e\u5b8c\u5168\u9690\u853d\u6027\u7684\u8bf4\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In this concept paper, we examine the main families of privacy attacks against predictive and generative ML, including membership inference attacks (MIAs), property inference attacks, and reconstruction attacks.

As a result, significant research efforts have been directed toward identifying failure scenarios within simulation environments. However, a critical question remains. Are the AV failure scenarios discovered in simulation reproducible on actual systems in the real world? The sim-to-real gap caused by differences between simulated and real sensor data means that failure scenarios identified in simulation might either be artifacts of synthetic sensor data or actual issues that also occur with real sensor data. To address this, an effective approach to validating simulated failure scenarios is to locate occurrences of these scenarios within real-world datasets and verify whether the failure persists on the datasets. To this end, we introduce a formal definition of how labeled time series sensor data can match an abstract scenario, represented as a scenario program using the Scenic probabilistic programming language. We present a querying algorithm that, given a scenario program and a labeled dataset, identifies the subset of data that matches the specified scenario. Our experiment shows that our algorithm is more accurate and orders of magnitude faster in querying scenarios than the state-of-the-art commercial vision large language models, and can scale with the duration of queried time series data.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper presents a method to validate simulation-identified failure scenarios in cyber-physical systems by matching them against real-world datasets using Scenic scenario programs, showing improved accuracy and speed over existing methods.", "motivation": "Addressing the sim-to-real gap in CPS testing by ensuring failure scenarios found in simulation are reproducible in real-world conditions.", "method": "Developed a formal definition for matching labeled time series sensor data to abstract scenarios using Scenic programming language, with an efficient querying algorithm.", "result": "The algorithm is more accurate and significantly faster than state-of-the-art commercial vision large language models, scaling well with data duration.", "conclusion": "This approach effectively validates simulated failure scenarios against real-world data, bridging the sim-to-real gap in CPS safety testing."}}
