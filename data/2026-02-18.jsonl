This study presents an Attention-Gated Recurrent Residual U-Net (R2U-Net) based Triplanar (2.5D) model for improved brain tumor segmentation. The proposed model enhances feature representation and segmentation accuracy by integrating residual, recurrent, and triplanar architectures while maintaining computational efficiency, potentially aiding in better treatment planning. The proposed method achieves a Dice Similarity Score (DSC) of 0.900 for Whole Tumor (WT) segmentation on the BraTS2021 validation set, demonstrating performance comparable to leading models. Additionally, the triplanar network extracts 64 features per planar model for survival days prediction, which are reduced to 28 using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). This approach achieves an accuracy of 45.71%, a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 108,318.128, and a Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient (SRC) of 0.338 on the test dataset."}

To instantiate this, we repurpose five oral and spotlight papers from ICML, ICLR, and ACL. From each paper's repository, we preserve the datasets, evaluation harness, and baseline implementations but withhold the paper's proposed method. This results in five containerized task environments comprising 39 sub-tasks in total. Within each environment, agents must propose novel hypotheses, run experiments, and attempt to surpass strong human baselines on the paper's metrics. In a controlled evaluation of an agent powered by GPT-5, we observe a sharp capability--reliability gap. The agent improves over the provided baselines from the repository in just 1 of 15 evaluations (6.7%) by 11.5%, and completes only 26.5% of sub-tasks on average. We identify recurring long-horizon failure modes, including impatience, poor time and resource management, overconfidence in weak hypotheses, difficulty coordinating parallel experiments, and hard limits from context length. Yet in a single run, the agent surpasses the solution of an ICML 2025 Spotlight task, indicating that frontier agents can occasionally reach state-of-the-art performance, but do so unreliably. We additionally evaluate proprietary agent scaffolds including Claude Code (Opus-4.5) and Codex (GPT-5.2) which display a similar gap. ResearchGym provides infrastructure for systematic evaluation and analysis of autonomous agents on closed-loop research."}

However, unauthorized use of knowledge distillation takes unfair advantage of the considerable effort and cost put into developing frontier models. We investigate methods for modifying teacher-generated reasoning traces to achieve two objectives that deter unauthorized distillation: (1) \\emph{anti-distillation}, or degrading the training usefulness of query responses, and (2) \\emph{API watermarking}, which embeds verifiable signatures in student models. We introduce several approaches for dynamically rewriting a teacher's reasoning outputs while preserving answer correctness and semantic coherence. Two of these leverage the rewriting capabilities of LLMs, while others use gradient-based techniques. Our experiments show that a simple instruction-based rewriting approach achieves a strong anti-distillation effect while maintaining or even improving teacher performance. Furthermore, we show that our rewriting approach also enables highly reliable watermark detection with essentially no false alarms."}

A common approach is retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which stores verbatim documents externally (as chunks) and retrieves only a relevant subset at inference time for an LLM to reason over. However, this results in inefficient usage of test-time compute (LLM repeatedly reasons over the same documents); moreover, chunk retrieval can inject irrelevant context that increases unsupported generation. We propose a human-like non-parametric continual learning framework, where the base model remains fixed, and learning occurs by integrating each new experience into an external semantic memory state that accumulates and consolidates itself continually. We present Panini, which realizes this by representing documents as Generative Semantic Workspaces (GSW) -- an entity- and event-aware network of question-answer (QA) pairs, sufficient for an LLM to reconstruct the experienced situations and mine latent knowledge via reasoning-grounded inference chains on the network. Given a query, Panini only traverses the continually-updated GSW (not the verbatim documents or chunks), and retrieves the most likely inference chains. Across six QA benchmarks, Panini achieves the highest average performance, 5%-7% higher than other competitive baselines, while using 2-30x fewer answer-context tokens, supports fully open-source pipelines, and reduces unsupported answers on curated unanswerable queries. The results show that efficient and accurate structuring of experiences at write time -- as achieved by the GSW framework -- yields both efficiency and reliability gains at read time.

Brittle fracture is modeled through a phase-field approach coupled with SPH, allowing crack initiation, propagation, and branching under dynamic loading without the need for additional criteria or local refinement. The framework also supports user-defined mathematical expressions to prescribe time- and space-dependent quantities, complementing the solid and fracture extensions and enhancing flexibility across existing and future DualSPHysics applications. Leveraging DualSPHysics' native CPU/GPU parallel architecture, the software achieves substantial computational acceleration for large-scale simulations, and the implementation is verified and validated against benchmark numerical problems and experimental data, demonstrating accuracy, robustness, and favorable scaling performance.

Built on the FIDO2 standard, they eliminate shared secrets and resist phishing while offering usability through platform credential managers. Since their introduction in 2022, major vendors have integrated passkeys into operating systems and browsers, and prominent websites have announced support. Yet the true extent of adoption across the broader web remains unknown.\n  Measuring this is challenging because websites implement passkeys in heterogeneous ways. Some expose explicit ``Sign in with passkey'' buttons, others hide options under multi-step flows or rely on conditional mediation, and many adopt external mechanisms such as JavaScript libraries or OAuth-based identity providers. There is no standardised discovery endpoint, and dynamic, JavaScript-heavy pages complicate automated detection.\n  This paper makes two contributions. First, we present Fidentikit, a browser-based crawler implementing 43 heuristics across five categories -- UI elements, DOM structures, WebAuthn API calls, network patterns, and library detection developed through iterative refinement over manual examination of 1,500 sites. Second, we apply Fidentikit to the top 100,000 Tranco-ranked domains, producing the first large-scale census of passkey adoption.

In circuit analysis, for example, a numerically correct solution is insufficient if it violates established methodological conventions such as mesh directionality or polarity assignments, errors that can propagate in safety-critical systems. Yet it remains unclear whether frontier models truly apply first-principles reasoning or rely on entrenched training priors that conflict with explicit instructions. We introduce CircuChain, a diagnostic benchmark designed to disentangle instruction compliance from physical reasoning competence in electrical circuit analysis. CircuChain consists of counterbalanced Control/Trap problem pairs across five canonical circuit topologies, augmented with systematic variations in sign conventions, current orientations, and polarity definitions. A multi-stage verification pipeline, combining symbolic solvers, SPICE simulation, and an LLM-based error taxonomy, enables fine-grained attribution of failures to convention errors, physics errors, arithmetic mistakes, or hallucinations. Across 100 tasks per model, we observe a consistent Compliance-Competence Divergence. The strongest model evaluated exhibits near-perfect physical reasoning but a high rate of convention violations when Trap conditions deliberately invert natural sign patterns. Conversely, weaker models display lower physical fidelity yet superior adherence to explicit instructions. These results suggest that increased model capability does not guarantee improved constraint alignment and highlight the need for new evaluation frameworks that stress instruction-following under mathematically rigid domains. CircuChain provides one such framework and offers actionable insights for both engineering education and AI alignment research."}

To address these challenges, this paper contributes a hybrid optimization approach combining machine learning with genetic algorithms for large-scale infrastructure renovation scheduling under uncertainty. We formulate the problem as a bi-level multi-objective optimization problem that explicitly accounts for uncertain infrastructure lifespans through probabilistic failure models. We develop a progressive lower bound evaluation method that integrates machine learning surrogate models with a multi-objective genetic algorithm to improve solution quality by enabling more iterations within fixed computational budgets. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness on substantially larger problem instances (76 projects) than previously addressed in the literature, achieving statistically significant improvements across multiple performance metrics by increasing computational efficiency up to 40 times compared to standard approaches."}

This decentralized approach has emerged as a promising solution for collaborative learning on sensitive user data, effectively addressing the longstanding privacy concerns inherent in centralized systems. However, the decentralized nature of FL exposes new security vulnerabilities, especially backdoor attacks that threaten model integrity. To investigate this critical concern, this paper presents the Layer Smoothing Attack (LSA), a novel backdoor attack that exploits layer-specific vulnerabilities in neural networks. First, a Layer Substitution Analysis methodology systematically identifies backdoor-critical (BC) layers that contribute most significantly to backdoor success. Subsequently, LSA strategically manipulates these BC layers to inject persistent backdoors while remaining undetected by state-of-the-art defense mechanisms. Extensive experiments across diverse model architectures and datasets demonstrate that LSA achieves a remarkably backdoor success rate of up to 97% while maintaining high model accuracy on the primary task, consistently bypassing modern FL defenses. These findings uncover fundamental vulnerabilities in current FL security frameworks, demonstrating that future defenses must incorporate layer-aware detection and mitigation strategies."}

A Contrast in Risky Choices Between Reasoning and Conversational LLMs", "comment": null, "summary": "The use of large language models either as decision support systems, or in agentic workflows, is rapidly transforming the digital ecosystem. However, the understanding of LLM decision-making under uncertainty remains limited. We initiate a comparative study of LLM risky choices along two dimensions: (1) prospect representation (explicit vs. experience based) and (2) decision rationale (explanation). Our study, which involves 20 frontier and open LLMs, is complemented by a matched human subjects experiment, which provides one reference point, while an expected payoff maximizing rational agent model provides another. We find that LLMs cluster into two categories: reasoning models (RMs) and conversational models (CMs). RMs tend towards rational behavior, are insensitive to the order of prospects, gain/loss framing, and explanations, and behave similarly whether prospects are explicit or presented via experience history. CMs are significantly less rational, slightly more human-like, sensitive to prospect ordering, framing, and explanation, and exhibit a large description-history gap. Paired comparisons of open LLMs suggest that a key factor differentiating RMs and CMs is training for mathematical reasoning."}

We systematically evaluate how system prompts of varying instructional detail, along with model scale, prompting strategy, and programming language, affect code assistant. Our experimental setting spans 360 configurations across four models, five system prompts, three prompting strategies, two languages, and two temperature settings.

To extend the service duration of AI agents, an energy minimization problem is formulated that jointly optimizes AI agent selection, base station (BS) beamforming, and AI agent transmission power, subject to latency and reasoning accuracy constraints. To address the formulated problem, we propose two resource allocation schemes, ASC and LAW, which first decompose it into three sub-problems. Specifically, ASC optimizes each sub-problem iteratively using the proposed alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithm, semi-definite relaxation (SDR), and successive convex approximation (SCA), while LAW tackles each sub-problem using the proposed large language model (LLM) optimizer within an agentic workflow.

Rather than reviewing each layer in isolation, we analyze how the same structural difficulties and effective responses recur across the stack. Our central finding is one of convergence. Despite the diversity of domains and tools, the field keeps encountering five recurring challenges (the feedback loop crisis, the tacit knowledge problem, trust and validation, co-design across boundaries, and the shift from determinism to dynamism) and keeps arriving at five design principles that independently emerge as effective responses (embracing hybrid approaches, designing for continuous feedback, separating concerns by role, matching methods to problem structure, and building on decades of systems knowledge). We organize these into a challenge--principle map that serves as a diagnostic and design aid, showing which principles have proven effective for which challenges across layers. Through concrete cross-stack examples, we show how systems navigate this map as they mature, and argue that the field needs shared engineering methodology, including common vocabularies, cross-layer benchmarks, and systematic design practices, so that progress compounds across communities rather than being rediscovered in each one. Our analysis covers more than 275 papers spanning eleven application areas across three layers of the computing stack, and distills open research questions that become visible only from a cross-layer vantage point."}

Over the past of decades, the research on code smell has received extensive attention. Especially the researches applied machine learning-technique have become a popular topic in recent studies. However, one of the biggest challenges to apply machine learning-technique is the lack of high-quality code smell datasets. Manually constructing such datasets is extremely labor-intensive, as identifying code smells requires substantial development expertise and considerable time investment. In contrast, automatically generated datasets, while scalable, frequently exhibit reduced label reliability and compromised data quality. To overcome this challenge, in this study, we explore a semi-automatic approach to generate a code smell dataset with high quality data samples. Specifically, we first applied a set of automatic generation rules to produce candidate smelly samples. We then employed multiple metrics to group the data samples into an automatically accepted group and a manually reviewed group, enabling reviewers to concentrate their efforts on ambiguous samples. Furthermore, we established structured review guidelines and developed a annotation tool to support the manual validation process. Based on the proposed semi-automatic generation approach, we created an open-source code smell dataset, SACS, covering three widely studied code smells: Long Method, Large Class, and Feature Envy.

Current methods face two major limitations. First, many rely on a single dataset or follow a sequential data fusion and generation process, which means they fail to capture the complex interplay between features. Second, these approaches struggle with sampling zeros (valid but unobserved attribute combinations) and structural zeros (infeasible combinations due to logical constraints), which reduce the diversity and feasibility of the generated data. This study proposes a novel method to simultaneously integrate and synthesize multi-source datasets using a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) with gradient penalty. This joint learning method improves both the diversity and feasibility of synthetic data by defining a regularization term (inverse gradient penalty) for the generator loss function. For the evaluation, we implement a unified evaluation metric for similarity, and place special emphasis on measuring diversity and feasibility through recall, precision, and the F1 score. Results show that the proposed joint approach outperforms the sequential baseline, with recall increasing by 7\\% and precision by 15\\%. Additionally, the regularization term further improves diversity and feasibility, reflected in a 10\\% increase in recall and 1\\% in precision. We assess similarity distributions using a five-metric score. The joint approach performs better overall, and reaches a score of 88.1 compared to 84.6 for the sequential method. Since synthetic populations serve as a key input for ABM, this multi-source generative approach has the potential to significantly enhance the accuracy and reliability of ABM."}

Watermarking has emerged as a promising countermeasure, with existing work largely focused on model quality preservation and robust detection. However, current schemes provide limited protection against false attribution. We strengthen the notion of soundness by introducing two novel guarantees: unforgeability and recoverability. Unforgeability prevents adversaries from crafting false positives, texts that are far from any output from the watermarked model but are nonetheless flagged as watermarked. Recoverability provides an additional layer of protection: whenever a watermark is detected, the detector identifies the source text from which the flagged content was derived. Together, these properties strengthen content ownership by linking content exclusively to its generating model, enabling secure attribution and fine-grained traceability. We construct the first undetectable watermarking scheme that is robust, unforgeable, and recoverable with respect to substitutions (i.e., perturbations in Hamming metric). The key technical ingredient is a new cryptographic primitive called robust (or recoverable) digital signatures, which allow verification of messages that are close to signed ones, while preventing forgery of messages that are far from all previously signed messages. We show that any standard digital signature scheme can be boosted to a robust one using property-preserving hash functions (Boyle, LaVigne, and Vaikuntanathan, ITCS 2019)."}

In the simple foraging task we study, every day, our agent has to find its way from its home, through barriers, to food. Moreover, the world is non-stationary: from day to day, the location of the barriers and food may change, and the agent's sensing such as its location information is uncertain and very limited. Any model construction, such as a map, and use, such as planning, needs to be robust against these challenges, and if any learning is to be useful, it needs to be adequately fast. We look at a range of strategies, from simple to sophisticated, with various uses of memory and learning. We find that an architecture that can incorporate multiple strategies is required to handle (sub)tasks of a different nature, in particular for exploration and search, when food location is not known, and for planning a good path to a remembered (likely) food location. An agent that utilizes non-stationary probability learning techniques to keep updating its (episodic) memories and that uses those memories to build maps and plan on the fly (imperfect maps, i.e. noisy and limited to the agent's experience) can be increasingly and substantially more efficient than the simpler (minimal-memory) agents, as the task difficulties such as distance to goal are raised, as long as the uncertainty, from localization and change, is not too large."}

In this paper, we introduce MarkSweep, a novel watermark removal attack that effectively erases the embedded watermarks from AI-generated images without degrading visual quality. MarkSweep first amplifies watermark noise in high-frequency regions via edge-aware Gaussian perturbations and injects it into clean images for training a denoising network. This network then integrates two modules, the learnable frequency decomposition module and the frequency-aware fusion module, to suppress amplified noise and eliminate watermark traces. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that invisible watermarks are highly vulnerable to MarkSweep, which effectively removes embedded watermarks, reducing the bit accuracy of HiDDeN and Stable Signature watermarking schemes to below 67%, while preserving perceptual quality of AI-generated images."}

Any single-bit change in the input produces a completely different hash, which is ideal for integrity verification but limits their usefulness in many real-world tasks like threat hunting, malware analysis and digital forensics, where adversaries routinely introduce minor transformations. Similarity-based techniques address this limitation by enabling approximate matching, allowing related byte sequences to produce measurably similar fingerprints. Modern enterprises manage tens of thousands of endpoints with billions of files, making the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed techniques more important than ever in security applications. Security researchers have proposed a range of approaches, including similarity digests and locality-sensitive hashes (e.g., ssdeep, sdhash, TLSH), as well as more recent machine-learning-based methods that generate embeddings from file features. However, these techniques have largely been evaluated in isolation, using disparate datasets and evaluation criteria. This paper presents a systematic comparison of learning-based classification and similarity methods using large, publicly available datasets. We evaluate each method under a unified experimental framework with industry-accepted metrics. To our knowledge, this is the first reproducible study to benchmark these diverse learning-based similarity techniques side by side for real-world security workloads. Our results show that no single approach performs well across all dimensions; instead, each exhibits distinct trade-offs, indicating that effective malware analysis and threat-hunting platforms must combine complementary classification and similarity techniques rather than rely on a single method."}

X-MAP combines SHAP-based feature attributions with non-negative matrix factorization to build interpretable topic profiles for reliably classified spam/phishing and legitimate messages, and measures each message's deviation from these profiles using Jensen-Shannon divergence. Experiments on SMS and phishing datasets show that misclassified messages exhibit at least two times larger divergence than correctly classified ones. As a detector, X-MAP achieves up to 0.98 AUROC and lowers the false-rejection rate at 95% TRR to 0.089 on positive predictions.

Within months, 48Club and Blockrazor produced over 96\\% of blocks and captured about 92\\% of MEV profits.\n  We find that profits concentrate in short, low-hop arbitrage routes over wrapped tokens and stablecoins, and that block construction rapidly converges toward monopoly. Beyond concentration alone, our analysis reveals a structural source of inequality: BSC's short block interval and whitelisted PBS collapse the contestable window for MEV competition, amplifying latency advantages and excluding slower builders and searchers. MEV extraction on BSC is not only more centralized than on Ethereum, but also structurally more vulnerable to censorship and weakened fairness."}

Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) excel at interpreting and generating text, but cannot directly reason over high-dimensional, heterogeneous agricultural datasets. We bridge this gap with an agentic framework for agricultural science. It provides a Python execution environment, AgriWorld, exposing unified tools for geospatial queries over field parcels, remote-sensing time-series analytics, crop growth simulation, and task-specific predictors (e.g., yield, stress, and disease risk). On top of this environment, we design a multi-turn LLM agent, Agro-Reflective, that iteratively writes code, observes execution results, and refines its analysis via an execute-observe-refine loop.

To overcome the cognitive isolation of individual models, we introduce a multi-agent collaboration process that enables an action model to consult a world model as a web-environment expert for strategic guidance; the action model then grounds these suggestions into executable actions, leveraging prior knowledge of environmental state transition dynamics to enhance candidate action proposal. To achieve risk-aware resilient task execution, we introduce a two-stage deduction chain.

While prior work typically relies on predefined test cases to evaluate correctness, in this work, we leverage differential fuzzing to check functional equivalence in LLM-generated code refactorings. Unlike test-based evaluation, a differential fuzzing-based equivalence checker needs no predefined test cases and can explore a much larger input space by executing and comparing thousands of automatically generated test inputs. In a large-scale evaluation of six LLMs (CodeLlama, Codestral, StarChat2, Qwen-2.5, Olmo-3, and GPT-4o) across three datasets and two refactoring types, we find that LLMs show a non-trivial tendency to alter program semantics, producing 19-35% functionally non-equivalent refactorings. Our experiments further demonstrate that about 21% of these non-equivalent refactorings remain undetected by the existing test suites of the three evaluated datasets. Collectively, the findings of this study imply that reliance on existing tests might overestimate functional equivalence in LLM-generated code refactorings, which remain prone to semantic divergence."}

To address these limitations, we introduce an adaptive abstention system that dynamically adjusts safety thresholds based on real-time contextual signals such as domain and user history. The proposed framework integrates a multi-dimensional detection architecture composed of five parallel detectors, combined through a hierarchical cascade mechanism to optimize both speed and precision. The cascade design reduces unnecessary computation by progressively filtering queries, achieving substantial latency improvements compared to non-cascaded models and external guardrail systems. Extensive evaluation on mixed and domain-specific workloads demonstrates significant reductions in false positives, particularly in sensitive domains such as medical advice and creative writing. The system maintains high safety precision and near-perfect recall under strict operating modes.

This design improves performance on long-horizon tasks but creates a security risk: untrusted external content observed during a benign session can be stored as memory and later treated as instruction. We study this risk and formalize a persistent attack we call a Zombie Agent, where an attacker covertly implants a payload that survives across sessions, effectively turning the agent into a puppet of the attacker.\n  We present a black-box attack framework that uses only indirect exposure through attacker-controlled web content. The attack has two phases. During infection, the agent reads a poisoned source while completing a benign task and writes the payload into long-term memory through its normal update process. During trigger, the payload is retrieved or carried forward and causes unauthorized tool behavior. We design mechanism-specific persistence strategies for common memory implementations, including sliding-window and retrieval-augmented memory, to resist truncation and relevance filtering. We evaluate the attack on representative agent setups and tasks, measuring both persistence over time and the ability to induce unauthorized actions while preserving benign task quality. Our results show that memory evolution can convert one-time indirect injection into persistent compromise, which suggests that defenses focused only on per-session prompt filtering are not sufficient for self-evolving agents."}

Our framework, denoted as SLAPX, enables privacy-preserving spectrum queries using delegatable anonymous credentials, supports adaptive location verification without revealing precise user location, and mitigates DoS attacks through verifiable delay functions (VDFs) combined with RLRS-based rate limiting. Extensive cryptographic benchmarking and network simulations demonstrate that SLAPX achieves significantly lower latency and communication overhead than existing solutions while effectively resisting location spoofing and DoS attacks. These results show that SLAPX is practical and well-suited for secure next-generation DB-CRN deployments."}

However, benchmarks can have problems that distort performance, like test set contamination and annotator error. How can we know that a benchmark is a reliable indicator of some capability that we want to measure? This question concerns the construct validity of LLM benchmarks, and it requires separating benchmark results from capabilities when we model and predict LLM performance.\n  Both social scientists and computer scientists propose formal models - latent factor models and scaling laws - for identifying the capabilities underlying benchmark scores. However, neither technique is satisfactory for construct validity. Latent factor models ignore scaling laws, and as a result, the capabilities they extract often proxy model size. Scaling laws ignore measurement error, and as a result, the capabilities they extract are both uninterpretable and overfit to the observed benchmarks.\n  This thesis presents the structured capabilities model, the first model to extract interpretable and generalisable capabilities from a large collection of LLM benchmark results. I fit this model and its two alternatives on a large sample of results from the OpenLLM Leaderboard. Structured capabilities outperform latent factor models on parsimonious fit indices, and exhibit better out-of-distribution benchmark prediction than scaling laws. These improvements are possible because neither existing approach separates model scale from capabilities in the appropriate way. Model scale should inform capabilities, as in scaling laws, and these capabilities should inform observed results up to measurement error, as in latent factor models. In combining these two insights, structured capabilities demonstrate better explanatory and predictive power for quantifying construct validity in LLM evaluations."}

We address this question with a layer-wise framework based on Partial Information Decomposition (PID) that decomposes the predictive information at each Transformer layer into redundant, vision-unique, language-unique, and synergistic components. To make PID tractable for high-dimensional neural representations, we introduce \\emph{PID Flow}, a pipeline combining dimensionality reduction, normalizing-flow Gaussianization, and closed-form Gaussian PID estimation. Applying this framework to LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-1.6-7B across six GQA reasoning tasks, we uncover a consistent \\emph{modal transduction} pattern: visual-unique information peaks early and decays with depth, language-unique information surges in late layers to account for roughly 82\\% of the final prediction, and cross-modal synergy remains below 2\\%. This trajectory is highly stable across model variants (layer-wise correlations $>$0.96) yet strongly task-dependent, with semantic redundancy governing the detailed information fingerprint.

However, existing evaluation methods primarily assess outcome based performance, such as safety and trajectory accuracy, without determining whether model decisions reflect human relevant considerations. As a result, it remains unclear whether explanations produced by such models correspond to genuine reason responsive decision making or merely post hoc rationalizations. This limitation is especially significant in safety critical domains because it can create false confidence. To address this gap, we propose CARE Drive, Context Aware Reasons Evaluation for Driving, a model agnostic framework for evaluating reason responsiveness in vision language models applied to automated driving. CARE Drive compares baseline and reason augmented model decisions under controlled contextual variation to assess whether human reasons causally influence decision behavior. The framework employs a two stage evaluation process. Prompt calibration ensures stable outputs. Systematic contextual perturbation then measures decision sensitivity to human reasons such as safety margins, social pressure, and efficiency constraints. We demonstrate CARE Drive in a cyclist overtaking scenario involving competing normative considerations. Results show that explicit human reasons significantly influence model decisions, improving alignment with expert recommended behavior. However, responsiveness varies across contextual factors, indicating uneven sensitivity to different types of reasons. These findings provide empirical evidence that reason responsiveness in foundation models can be systematically evaluated without modifying model parameters."}

Our key insight is that personality traits appear as extractable, approximately orthogonal directions in the model's representation space that support algebraic operations. The framework operates through three stages: Persona-Base extracts orthogonal trait vectors via contrastive activation analysis; Persona-Algebra enables precise control through vector arithmetic (scalar multiplication for intensity, addition for composition, subtraction for suppression); and Persona-Flow achieves context-aware adaptation by dynamically composing these vectors during inference. On PersonalityBench, our approach achieves a mean score of 9.60, nearly matching the supervised fine-tuning upper bound of 9.61 without any gradient updates. On our proposed Persona-Evolve benchmark for dynamic personality adaptation, we achieve up to 91% win rates across diverse model families. These results provide evidence that aspects of LLM personality are mathematically tractable, opening new directions for interpretable and efficient behavioral control."}

When the required abstraction is not already encoded in this space, performance collapses. We propose Recursive Concept Evolution (RCE), a framework that enables pretrained language models to modify their internal representation geometry during inference. RCE introduces dynamically generated low-rank concept subspaces that are spawned when representational inadequacy is detected, selected through a minimum description length criterion, merged when synergistic, and consolidated via constrained optimization to preserve stability. This process allows the model to construct new abstractions rather than recombining existing ones. We integrate RCE with Mistral-7B and evaluate it across compositional reasoning benchmarks. RCE yields 12-18 point gains on ARC-AGI-2, 8-14 point improvements on GPQA and BBH, and consistent reductions in depth-induced error on MATH and HLE."}

To solve this issue, we propose Global State Diffusion Algorithm~(GlobeDiff) to infer the global state based on the local observations. By formulating the state inference process as a multi-modal diffusion process, GlobeDiff overcomes ambiguities in state estimation while simultaneously inferring the global state with high fidelity. We prove that the estimation error of GlobeDiff under both unimodal and multi-modal distributions can be bounded. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that GlobeDiff achieves superior performance and is capable of accurately inferring the global state."}

We contrast two strategies for obtaining valid estimates of causal effects and clarify the assumptions under which each is suitable for exploratory versus confirmatory research. Heuristic approaches seek to establish that simulated and observed human behavior are interchangeable through prompt engineering, model fine-tuning, and other repair strategies designed to reduce LLM-induced inaccuracies. While useful for many exploratory tasks, heuristic approaches lack the formal statistical guarantees typically required for confirmatory research. In contrast, statistical calibration combines auxiliary human data with statistical adjustments to account for discrepancies between observed and simulated responses. Under explicit assumptions, statistical calibration preserves validity and provides more precise estimates of causal effects at lower cost than experiments that rely solely on human participants. Yet the potential of both approaches depends on how well LLMs approximate the relevant populations. We consider what opportunities are overlooked when researchers focus myopically on substituting LLMs for human participants in a study."}

Conventional encoding methods (e.g., one-hot) often fail to convey the nuanced relationships among closely related subtypes, limiting AI's semantic comprehension. To address this limitation, this study proposes a novel training approach that employs large language model (LLM) embeddings (e.g., OpenAI GPT and Meta LLaMA) as encodings to preserve finer distinctions in building semantics. We evaluated the proposed method by training GraphSAGE models to classify 42 building object subtypes across five high-rise residential building information models (BIMs). Various embedding dimensions were tested, including original high-dimensional LLM embeddings (1,536, 3,072, or 4,096) and 1,024-dimensional compacted embeddings generated via the Matryoshka representation model. Experimental results demonstrated that LLM encodings outperformed the conventional one-hot baseline, with the llama-3 (compacted) embedding achieving a weighted average F1-score of 0.8766, compared to 0.8475 for one-hot encoding. The results underscore the promise of leveraging LLM-based encodings to enhance AI's ability to interpret complex, domain-specific building semantics. As the capabilities of LLMs and dimensionality reduction techniques continue to evolve, this approach holds considerable potential for broad application in semantic elaboration tasks throughout the AECO industry."}

In circuit analysis, for example, a numerically correct solution is insufficient if it violates established methodological conventions such as mesh directionality or polarity assignments, errors that can propagate in safety-critical systems. Yet it remains unclear whether frontier models truly apply first-principles reasoning or rely on entrenched training priors that conflict with explicit instructions. We introduce CircuChain, a diagnostic benchmark designed to disentangle instruction compliance from physical reasoning competence in electrical circuit analysis. CircuChain consists of counterbalanced Control/Trap problem pairs across five canonical circuit topologies, augmented with systematic variations in sign conventions, current orientations, and polarity definitions. A multi-stage verification pipeline, combining symbolic solvers, SPICE simulation, and an LLM-based error taxonomy, enables fine-grained attribution of failures to convention errors, physics errors, arithmetic mistakes, or hallucinations. Across 100 tasks per model, we observe a consistent Compliance-Competence Divergence. The strongest model evaluated exhibits near-perfect physical reasoning but a high rate of convention violations when Trap conditions deliberately invert natural sign patterns. Conversely, weaker models display lower physical fidelity yet superior adherence to explicit instructions. These results suggest that increased model capability does not guarantee improved constraint alignment and highlight the need for new evaluation frameworks that stress instruction-following under mathematically rigid domains. CircuChain provides one such framework and offers actionable insights for both engineering education and AI alignment research."}

To investigate this critical concern, this paper presents the Layer Smoothing Attack (LSA), a novel backdoor attack that exploits layer-specific vulnerabilities in neural networks. First, a Layer Substitution Analysis methodology systematically identifies backdoor-critical (BC) layers that contribute most significantly to backdoor success. Subsequently, LSA strategically manipulates these BC layers to inject persistent backdoors while remaining undetected by state-of-the-art defense mechanisms. Extensive experiments across diverse model architectures and datasets demonstrate that LSA achieves a remarkably backdoor success rate of up to 97% while maintaining high model accuracy on the primary task, consistently bypassing modern FL defenses. These findings uncover fundamental vulnerabilities in current FL security frameworks, demonstrating that future defenses must incorporate layer-aware detection and mitigation strategies."}

Rather than reviewing each layer in isolation, we analyze how the same structural difficulties and effective responses recur across the stack. Our central finding is one of convergence. Despite the diversity of domains and tools, the field keeps encountering five recurring challenges (the feedback loop crisis, the tacit knowledge problem, trust and validation, co-design across boundaries, and the shift from determinism to dynamism) and keeps arriving at five design principles that independently emerge as effective responses (embracing hybrid approaches, designing for continuous feedback, separating concerns by role, matching methods to problem structure, and building on decades of systems knowledge). We organize these into a challenge--principle map that serves as a diagnostic and design aid, showing which principles have proven effective for which challenges across layers. Through concrete cross-stack examples, we show how systems navigate this map as they mature, and argue that the field needs shared engineering methodology, including common vocabularies, cross-layer benchmarks, and systematic design practices, so that progress compounds across communities rather than being rediscovered in each one.

Watermarking has emerged as a promising countermeasure, with existing work largely focused on model quality preservation and robust detection. However, current schemes provide limited protection against false attribution. We strengthen the notion of soundness by introducing two novel guarantees: unforgeability and recoverability. Unforgeability prevents adversaries from crafting false positives, texts that are far from any output from the watermarked model but are nonetheless flagged as watermarked. Recoverability provides an additional layer of protection: whenever a watermark is detected, the detector identifies the source text from which the flagged content was derived. Together, these properties strengthen content ownership by linking content exclusively to its generating model, enabling secure attribution and fine-grained traceability. We construct the first undetectable watermarking scheme that is robust, unforgeable, and recoverable with respect to substitutions (i.e., perturbations in Hamming metric). The key technical ingredient is a new cryptographic primitive called robust (or recoverable) digital signatures, which allow verification of messages that are close to signed ones, while preventing forgery of messages that are far from all previously signed messages. We show that any standard digital signature scheme can be boosted to a robust one using property-preserving hash functions (Boyle, LaVigne, and Vaikuntanathan, ITCS 2019)."}

Similarity-based techniques address this limitation by enabling approximate matching, allowing related byte sequences to produce measurably similar fingerprints. Modern enterprises manage tens of thousands of endpoints with billions of files, making the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed techniques more important than ever in security applications. Security researchers have proposed a range of approaches, including similarity digests and locality-sensitive hashes (e.g., ssdeep, sdhash, TLSH), as well as more recent machine-learning-based methods that generate embeddings from file features. However, these techniques have largely been evaluated in isolation, using disparate datasets and evaluation criteria. This paper presents a systematic comparison of learning-based classification and similarity methods using large, publicly available datasets. We evaluate each method under a unified experimental framework with industry-accepted metrics. To our knowledge, this is the first reproducible study to benchmark these diverse learning-based similarity techniques side by side for real-world security workloads. Our results show that no single approach performs well across all dimensions; instead, each exhibits distinct trade-offs, indicating that effective malware analysis and threat-hunting platforms must combine complementary classification and similarity techniques rather than rely on a single method."}

SecCodeBench-V2 comprises 98 generation and fix scenarios derived from Alibaba Group's industrial productions, where the underlying security issues span 22 common CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) categories across five programming languages: Java, C, Python, Go, and Node.js. SecCodeBench-V2 adopts a function-level task formulation: each scenario provides a complete project scaffold and requires the model to implement or patch a designated target function under fixed interfaces and dependencies. For each scenario, SecCodeBench-V2 provides executable proof-of-concept (PoC) test cases for both functional validation and security verification. All test cases are authored and double-reviewed by security experts, ensuring high fidelity, broad coverage, and reliable ground truth. Beyond the benchmark itself, we build a unified evaluation pipeline that assesses models primarily via dynamic execution. For most scenarios, we compile and run model-generated artifacts in isolated environments and execute PoC test cases to validate both functional correctness and security properties. For scenarios where security issues cannot be adjudicated with deterministic test cases, we additionally employ an LLM-as-a-judge oracle. To summarize performance across heterogeneous scenarios and difficulty levels, we design a Pass@K-based scoring protocol with principled aggregation over scenarios and severity, enabling holistic and comparable evaluation across models. Overall, SecCodeBench-V2 provides a rigorous and reproducible foundation for assessing the security posture of AI coding assistants, with results and artifacts released at https://alibaba.github.io/sec-code-bench. The benchmark is publicly available at https://github.com/alibaba/sec-code-bench."}

This design improves performance on long-horizon tasks but creates a security risk: untrusted external content observed during a benign session can be stored as memory and later treated as instruction. We study this risk and formalize a persistent attack we call a Zombie Agent, where an attacker covertly implants a payload that survives across sessions, effectively turning the agent into a puppet of the attacker.\n  We present a black-box attack framework that uses only indirect exposure through attacker-controlled web content. The attack has two phases. During infection, the agent reads a poisoned source while completing a benign task and writes the payload into long-term memory through its normal update process. During trigger, the payload is retrieved or carried forward and causes unauthorized tool behavior. We design mechanism-specific persistence strategies for common memory implementations, including sliding-window and retrieval-augmented memory, to resist truncation and relevance filtering. We evaluate the attack on representative agent setups and tasks, measuring both persistence over time and the ability to induce unauthorized actions while preserving benign task quality. Our results show that memory evolution can convert one-time indirect injection into persistent compromise, which suggests that defenses focused only on per-session prompt filtering are not sufficient for self-evolving agents."}
