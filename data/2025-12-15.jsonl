Classical methods usually follow a two-stage framework: machine learning algorithms are employed to produce forecasts that closely fit the realized returns, and the predicted values are then used in a downstream portfolio optimization problem to determine the asset weights. This separation leads to a fundamental misalignment between predictions and decision outcomes, while also ignoring the impact of transaction costs. To bridge this gap, recent studies have proposed the idea of end-to-end learning, integrating the two stages into a single pipeline. This paper introduces IPMO (Integrated Prediction and Multi-period Portfolio Optimization), a model for multi-period mean-variance portfolio optimization with turnover penalties. The predictor generates multi-period return forecasts that parameterize a differentiable convex optimization layer, which in turn drives learning via portfolio performance. For scalability, we introduce a mirror-descent fixed-point (MDFP) differentiation scheme that avoids factorizing the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) systems, which thus yields stable implicit gradients and nearly scale-insensitive runtime as the decision horizon grows. In experiments with real market data and two representative time-series prediction models, the IPMO method consistently outperforms the two-stage benchmarks in risk-adjusted performance net of transaction costs and achieves more coherent allocation paths. Our results show that integrating machine learning prediction with optimization in the multi-period setting improves financial outcomes and remains computationally tractable."}

To address this, we propose a novel multi-task learning (MTL) framework designed to jointly enhance accuracy and interpretability. Our architecture integrates a shared chemical language model with task-specific attention modules. By imposing an L1 sparsity penalty on these modules, the framework is constrained to focus on a minimal set of salient molecular fragments for each distinct toxicity endpoint. The resulting framework is trained end-to-end and is readily adaptable to various transformer-based backbones. Evaluated on the ClinTox, SIDER, and Tox21 benchmark datasets, our approach consistently outperforms both single-task and standard MTL baselines. Crucially, the sparse attention weights provide chemically intuitive visualizations that reveal the specific fragments influencing predictions, thereby enhancing insight into the model's decision-making process."}

Consequently, there is a growing need for more efficient testing methods. To reduce the burden on developers, various automated test generation tools have been developed, and several studies have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the tests they produce. However, most of these studies focus primarily on coverage metrics, and only a few examine how well the tests support fault localization-particularly using artificial faults introduced through mutation testing. In this study, we compare the SBFL (Spectrum-Based Fault Localization) score and code coverage of automatically generated tests with those of manually created tests. The SBFL score indicates how accurately faults can be localized using SBFL techniques. By employing SBFL score as an evaluation metric-an approach rarely used in prior studies on test generation-we aim to provide new insights into the respective strengths and weaknesses of manually created and automatically generated tests. Our experimental results show that automatically generated tests achieve higher branch coverage than manually created tests, but their SBFL score is lower, especially for code with deeply nested structures. These findings offer guidance on how to effectively combine automatically generated and manually created testing approaches."}

While existing defenses effectively counter obvious threats such as out-of-context trigger words and safety alignment violations, they fail against sophisticated attacks using contextually-appropriate triggers that blend seamlessly into natural language. This paper introduces three novel contextually-aware attack scenarios that exploit domain-specific knowledge and semantic plausibility: the ViralApp attack targeting social media addiction classification, the Fever attack manipulating medical diagnosis toward hypertension, and the Referral attack steering clinical recommendations. These attacks represent realistic threats where malicious actors exploit domain-specific vocabulary while maintaining semantic coherence, demonstrating how adversaries can weaponize contextual appropriateness to evade conventional detection methods. To counter both traditional and these sophisticated attacks, we present \\textbf{SCOUT (Saliency-based Classification Of Untrusted Tokens)}, a novel defense framework that identifies backdoor triggers through token-level saliency analysis rather than traditional context-based detection methods. SCOUT constructs a saliency map by measuring how the removal of individual tokens affects the model's output logits for the target label, enabling detection of both conspicuous and subtle manipulation attempts.

However, these approaches typically rely on supervised learning, assume access to true optimal decisions, and use surrogates for the MILP gradients. In this work, we introduce a proof of concept CORL framework that end to end fine tunes an MILP scheme using reinforcement learning (RL) on real world data to maximize its operational performance.

To address these challenges, this paper proposes AutoFSM, a multi-agent collaborative framework designed for FSM code generation tasks. AutoFSM introduces a structurally clear intermediate representation (IR) to reduce syntax error rate during code generation and provides a supporting toolchain to enable automatic translation from IR to Verilog. Furthermore, AutoFSM is the first to integrate SystemC-based modeling with automatic testbench generation, thereby improving debugging efficiency and feedback quality. To systematically evaluate the framework's performance, we construct SKT-FSM, the first hierarchical FSM benchmark in the field, comprising 67 FSM samples across different complexity levels. Experimental results show that, under the same base LLM, AutoFSM consistently outperforms the open-source framework MAGE on the SKT-FSM benchmark, achieving up to an 11.94% improvement in pass rate and up to a 17.62% reduction in syntax error rate. These results demonstrate the potential of combining LLMs with structured IR and automated testing to improve the reliability and scalability of register-transfer level (RTL) code generation."}

Our front end accepts a subset of C with lightweight privacy annotations and lowers it to LLVM IR, allowing us to reuse mature analyses and transformations to automatically batch independent arithmetic operations. Our back end performs data-flow and control-flow analysis on the optimized IR to drive a non-blocking runtime scheduler that overlaps independent operations and aggressively overlaps communication with computation; when enabled, it can map batched operations to GPU kernels. This design preserves a low learning curve by using a mainstream language and hiding optimization and hardware-specific mechanics from programmers. We evaluate the system on controlled microbenchmarks against MP-SPDZ, focusing on online phase performance. Our CPU back end achieves up to 5.56 times speedup under intermediate and heavy algebraic workloads, shows strong scaling with thread count, and our GPU back end scales better as the input size increases.

The key challenge is to couple combinatorial bundle selection with pickup-and-delivery routing under sub-second latency. We propose a learning--accelerated hybrid search pipeline that pairs a Transformer Neural Network-based constructive policy with an innovative Multi-Start Large Neighborhood Search (MSLNS) metaheuristic within a rolling-horizon scheme in which the platform repeatedly freezes the current marketplace into a static snapshot and solves it under a short time budget. This pairing leverages the low-latency, high-quality inference of the learning-based constructor alongside the robustness of improvement search; the multi-start design and plausible seeds help LNS to explore the solution space more efficiently. Across benchmarks, our method outperforms state-of-the-art neural combinatorial optimization and metaheuristic baselines in solution quality with comparable time, achieving an optimality gap of less than 2\\% in total revenue relative to the best available exact baseline method.

Recent work demonstrates that techniques such as repeated sampling, self-verification, and self-reflection can significantly enhance task success by allocating more inference-time compute. However, applying these techniques across multiple agents in a multi-agent system is difficult: there does not exist principled mechanisms to allocate compute to foster collaboration among agents, to extend test-time scaling to collaborative interactions, or to distribute compute across agents under explicit budget constraints. To address this gap, we propose FutureWeaver, a framework for planning and optimizing test-time compute allocation in multi-agent systems under fixed budgets. FutureWeaver introduces modularized collaboration, formalized as callable functions that encapsulate reusable multi-agent workflows. These modules are automatically derived through self-play reflection by abstracting recurring interaction patterns from past trajectories. Building on these modules, FutureWeaver employs a dual-level planning architecture that optimizes compute allocation by reasoning over the current task state while also speculating on future steps. Experiments on complex agent benchmarks demonstrate that FutureWeaver consistently outperforms baselines across diverse budget settings, validating its effectiveness for multi-agent collaboration in inference-time optimization."}

However, despite their promising capabilities, CodeLLMs can inadvertently memorize and reproduce snippets from their training data, which poses risks of privacy breaches and intellectual property violations. These risks restrict the deployment of CodeLLMs in sensitive domains and limit their training datasets to publicly available sources. To mitigate the memorization risk without compromising their task performance, we apply Differential Privacy (DP) to CodeLLMs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study that systematically evaluates the effectiveness of DP in CodeLLMs. DP adds calibrated noise to the training process to protect individual data points while still allowing the model to learn useful patterns. To this end, we first identify and understand the driving reasons of the memorization behaviour of the CodeLLMs during their fine-tuning. Then, to address this issue, we empirically evaluate the effect of DP on mitigating memorization while preserving code generation capabilities. Our findings show that DP substantially reduces memorization in CodeLLMs across all the tested snippet types. The snippet types most prone to memorization are also the most effectively mitigated by DP. Furthermore, we observe that DP slightly increases perplexity but preserves, and can even enhance, the code generation capabilities of CodeLLMs, which makes it feasible to apply DP in practice without significantly compromising model utility. Finally, we analyze the impact of DP on training efficiency and energy consumption, finding that DP does not significantly affect training time or energy usage, making it a practical choice for privacy-preserving CodeLLMs training."}

To evaluate MiniScope, we create a synthetic dataset derived from ten popular real-world applications, capturing the complexity of realistic agentic tasks beyond existing simplified benchmarks. Our evaluation shows that MiniScope incurs only 1-6% latency overhead compared to vanilla tool calling agents, while significantly outperforming the LLM based baseline in minimizing permissions as well as computational and operational costs."}

However, existing benchmarks based on visual CAPTCHAs still face limitations. Previous studies, when designing benchmarks and datasets, customized them according to their research objectives. Consequently, these benchmarks cannot comprehensively cover all CAPTCHA types. Notably, there is a dearth of dedicated benchmarks for LVLMs. To address this problem, we introduce a novel CAPTCHA benchmark for the first time, named CAPTURE CAPTCHA for Testing Under Real-world Experiments, specifically for LVLMs. Our benchmark encompasses 4 main CAPTCHA types and 25 sub-types from 31 vendors. The diversity enables a multi-dimensional and thorough evaluation of LVLM performance. CAPTURE features extensive class variety, large-scale data, and unique LVLM-tailored labels, filling the gaps in previous research in terms of data comprehensiveness and labeling pertinence. When evaluated by this benchmark, current LVLMs demonstrate poor performance in solving CAPTCHAs."}

We design and implement a proof-of-concept LLVM-based optimization pipeline for the SPDZ protocol that addresses these bottlenecks. Our front end accepts a subset of C with lightweight privacy annotations and lowers it to LLVM IR, allowing us to reuse mature analyses and transformations to automatically batch independent arithmetic operations. Our back end performs data-flow and control-flow analysis on the optimized IR to drive a non-blocking runtime scheduler that overlaps independent operations and aggressively overlaps communication with computation; when enabled, it can map batched operations to GPU kernels. This design preserves a low learning curve by using a mainstream language and hiding optimization and hardware-specific mechanics from programmers. We evaluate the system on controlled microbenchmarks against MP-SPDZ, focusing on online phase performance. Our CPU back end achieves up to 5.56 times speedup under intermediate and heavy algebraic workloads, shows strong scaling with thread count, and our GPU back end scales better as the input size increases. Overall, these results indicate that leveraging LLVM with protocol-aware scheduling is an effective architectural direction for extracting parallelism without sacrificing usability."}

Recent works proposed ASICs to accelerate FHE, but require expensive advanced manufacturing processes that constrain their accessibility. GPUs are a far more accessible platform, but achieving ASIC-level performance using GPUs has remained elusive. Furthermore, state-of-the-art approaches primarily focus on small models that fit comfortably within a single device. Supporting large models such as LLMs in FHE introduces a dramatic increase in computational complexity that requires optimized GPU kernels, along with managing terabyte-scale memory footprints that far exceed the capacity of a single GPU. This paper presents Cerium, a multi-GPU framework for FHE inference on large models. Cerium integrates a domain-specific language, an optimizing compiler, and a runtime system to automatically generate high-performance GPU kernels, manage terabyte-scale memory footprints, and parallelize computation across multiple GPUs. It introduces new IR constructs, compiler passes, sparse polynomial representations, memory-efficient data layouts, and communication-aware parallelization techniques that together enable encrypted inference for models ranging from small CNNs to Llama3-8B. We build Cerium on NVIDIA GPUs and demonstrate significant performance gains. For small models, Cerium outperforms expert-written hand-optimized GPU libraries by up to 2.25 times. Cerium achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art FHE ASICs, outright matching prior FHE ASIC CraterLake. It is the first GPU system to execute bootstrapping in under 10 milliseconds, achieving 7.5 milliseconds, and is the first to demonstrate encrypted inference for BERT-Base and Llama3-8B in 8 seconds and 134 seconds, respectively."}

To address this issue, we propose a novel and effective framework for detecting cyberattacks within blockchain systems. Our framework begins with a preprocessing tool that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to transform key features of blockchain transactions into image representations. These images are then analyzed through vision-based analysis using Vision Transformers (ViT), a recent advancement in computer vision known for its superior ability to capture complex patterns and semantic relationships. By integrating NLP-based preprocessing with vision-based learning, our framework can detect a wide variety of attack types.

While recent work improves MAS cost-effectiveness by shaping inter-agent communication topologies and selecting agent backbones, it rarely models and optimizes under explicit token-cost and latency budgets that reflect deployment constraints. This often leads to topology-first designs and suboptimal cost-effectiveness when budgets are binding. We present AgentBalance, a framework for constructing cost-effective MAS under explicit token-cost and latency budgets via a backbone-then-topology design. AgentBalance first performs backbone-oriented agent generation, constructing agents with heterogeneous backbones through LLM pool construction, pool selection, and role-backbone matching. It then performs adaptive MAS topology generation, guiding inter-agent communication via agent representation learning, gating, and latency-aware topology synthesis. Experiments on benchmarks with 14 candidate LLM backbones show that AgentBalance achieves up to 10% and 22% performance gains under matched token-cost and latency budgets, respectively, and yields strong AUC on performance-versus-budget curves across benchmarks. AgentBalance also functions as a plug-in for existing MAS, improving performance under the same token-cost and latency constraints, and it generalizes well to unseen LLMs for practical, budget-aware deployment.

These metrics rely on a baseline function to alter the pixels of the input image that the attribution map deems most important. In this work, we highlight a critical problem with these metrics: the choice of a given baseline will inevitably favour certain attribution methods over others. More concerningly, even a simple linear model with commonly used baselines contradicts itself by designating different optimal methods. A question then arises: which baseline should we use? We propose to study this problem through two desirable properties of a baseline: (i) that it removes information and (ii) that it does not produce overly out-of-distribution (OOD) images. We first show that none of the tested baselines satisfy both criteria, and there appears to be a trade-off among current baselines: either they remove information or they produce a sequence of OOD images. Finally, we introduce a novel baseline by leveraging recent work in feature visualisation to artificially produce a model-dependent baseline that removes information without being overly OOD, thus improving on the trade-off when compared to other existing baselines.

This paper presents the first systematic comparison of classical optimization and AI approaches to this problem, evaluating their performance against traditional algorithms. We apply PatternBoost transformer learning and reinforcement learning (PPO) to this problem for the first time, comparing them against ILP. ILP achieves provably optimal solutions up to 19 by 19 grids, while PatternBoost matches optimal performance up to 14 by 14 grids with 96% test loss reduction.

GitHub Actions is a popular CI/CD platform that enables project maintainers to create custom workflows -- collections of jobs composed of sequential steps -- using reusable components known as actions. Wary of the security risks introduced by fully-privileged actions, GitHub provides a job-level permission model for controlling workflow access to repository resources. Unfortunately, this model is too coarse-grained to reduce the attack surface pertaining to permission misuse attacks: All actions within a job share the same permissions granted to the job. This violates the principle of least privilege and can lead to broader software supply chain attacks, whenever a compromised action exploits the granted permissions to compromise the repository resources. In this paper, we present Granite, a runtime proxy-based system that enforces fine-grained permissions for GitHub Actions at the step-level granularity within a job. Granite transparently monitors requests made by JavaScript and composite actions during workflow execution and checks them against predefined step-level policies at runtime. We evaluate Granite in terms of compatibility, security, and performance overhead using a dataset of 500 workflows comprising 12,916 jobs from the most-starred GitHub repositories that use GitHub Actions. Our analysis reveals that 52.7% of the jobs can be protected by Granite against permission misuse attacks. We evaluate Granite on 20 top-starred repositories (63 actions, 58 workflows), validate attack prevention using 10 permission misuse attacks across 42 overprivileged jobs, and measure an average overhead of 55% (3.67 seconds) per job, concluding that Granite effectively reduces CI/CD attack surfaces."}

Overall, DeepSeek consistently screened a 4.8-49.7-fold larger literature corpus and reported 1.6-2.4-fold more biological control agents or management solutions than ChatGPT. As a result, DeepSeek reported 21.6% higher efficacy estimates, exhibited greater laboratory-to-field data consistency, and showed more realistic effects of pest identity and management tactics.

A plausible approach to protecting this metadata is to have senders post encrypted messages on a public bulletin board and receivers scan it for relevant messages. Oblivious message retrieval (OMR) leverages homomorphic encryption (HE) to improve user experience in this solution by delegating the scan to a resource-rich server while preserving privacy. A key process in OMR is the homomorphic detection of pertinent messages for the receiver from the bulletin board. It relies on a specialized matrix-vector multiplication algorithm, which involves extensive multiplications between ciphertext vectors and plaintext matrices, as well as homomorphic rotations. The computationally intensive nature of this process limits the practicality of OMR. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a hardware architecture to accelerate the matrix-vector multiplication algorithm. The building homomorphic operators in this algorithm are implemented using high-level synthesis, with design parameters for different parallelism levels. These operators are then deployed on a field-programmable gate array platform using an efficient design space exploration strategy to accelerate homomorphic matrix-vector multiplication.

LLMs are increasingly being used to process untrusted text inputs and even generate executable code, often while having access to sensitive system controls. To address these security concerns, several companies have introduced guard models, which are smaller, specialized models designed to protect text generation models from adversarial or malicious inputs. In this work, we advance the study of adversarial inputs by introducing Super Suffixes, suffixes capable of overriding multiple alignment objectives across various models with different tokenization schemes. We demonstrate their effectiveness, along with our joint optimization technique, by successfully bypassing the protection mechanisms of Llama Prompt Guard 2 on five different text generation models for malicious text and code generation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to reveal that Llama Prompt Guard 2 can be compromised through joint optimization.\n  Additionally, by analyzing the changing similarity of a model's internal state to specific concept directions during token sequence processing, we propose an effective and lightweight method to detect Super Suffix attacks. We show that the cosine similarity between the residual stream and certain concept directions serves as a distinctive fingerprint of model intent. Our proposed countermeasure, DeltaGuard, significantly improves the detection of malicious prompts generated through Super Suffixes. It increases the non-benign classification rate to nearly 100%, making DeltaGuard a valuable addition to the guard model stack and enhancing robustness against adversarial prompt attacks."}

Notably, GPT-4o made a severe misjudgment in the risk assessment for pulmonary embolism (PE) secondary to deep vein thrombosis (DVT). This research is the first to empirically confirm that LLMs exhibit features resembling metabolic dysfunction when processing clinical information, proposing the innovative concept of \"AI-Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (AI-MASLD)\". These findings offer a crucial safety warning for the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare, emphasizing that current LLMs must be used as auxiliary tools under human expert supervision, as there remains a significant gap between their theoretical knowledge and practical clinical application."}

This calls for skills and education in AI Benchmark Carpentry. From our experience with MLCommons, educational initiatives, and programs like the DOE's Trillion Parameter Consortium, key barriers include high resource demands, limited access to specialized hardware, lack of benchmark design expertise, and uncertainty in relating results to application domains. Current benchmarks often emphasize peak performance on top-tier hardware, offering limited guidance for diverse, real-world scenarios.\n  Benchmarking must become dynamic, incorporating evolving models, updated data, and heterogeneous platforms while maintaining transparency, reproducibility, and interpretability. Democratization requires both technical innovation and systematic education across levels, building sustained expertise in benchmark design and use.

Tasks such as drug recommendation, treatment planning, and adverse-effect prediction demand robust, multi-step reasoning grounded in reliable biomedical knowledge. Agentic AI methods, exemplified by TxAgent, address these challenges through iterative retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). TxAgent employs a fine-tuned Llama-3.1-8B model that dynamically generates and executes function calls to a unified biomedical tool suite (ToolUniverse), integrating FDA Drug API, OpenTargets, and Monarch resources to ensure access to current therapeutic information. In contrast to general-purpose RAG systems, medical applications impose stringent safety constraints, rendering the accuracy of both the reasoning trace and the sequence of tool invocations critical. These considerations motivate evaluation protocols treating token-level reasoning and tool-usage behaviors as explicit supervision signals. This work presents insights derived from our participation in the CURE-Bench NeurIPS 2025 Challenge, which benchmarks therapeutic-reasoning systems using metrics that assess correctness, tool utilization, and reasoning quality. We analyze how retrieval quality for function (tool) calls influences overall model performance and demonstrate performance gains achieved through improved tool-retrieval strategies.

However, the inherent unreliability of LLMs introduces fundamental security risks when these agents operate over sensitive user services. Prior approaches either rely on manually written policies that require security expertise, or place LLMs in the confinement loop, which lacks rigorous security guarantees. We present MiniScope, a framework that enables tool calling agents to operate on user accounts while confining potential damage from unreliable LLMs. MiniScope introduces a novel way to automatically and rigorously enforce least privilege principles by reconstructing permission hierarchies that reflect relationships among tool calls and combining them with a mobile-style permission model to balance security and ease of use. To evaluate MiniScope, we create a synthetic dataset derived from ten popular real-world applications, capturing the complexity of realistic agentic tasks beyond existing simplified benchmarks. Our evaluation shows that MiniScope incurs only 1-6% latency overhead compared to vanilla tool calling agents, while significantly outperforming the LLM based baseline in minimizing permissions as well as computational and operational costs."}

Recent works proposed ASICs to accelerate FHE, but require expensive advanced manufacturing processes that constrain their accessibility. GPUs are a far more accessible platform, but achieving ASIC-level performance using GPUs has remained elusive. Furthermore, state-of-the-art approaches primarily focus on small models that fit comfortably within a single device. Supporting large models such as LLMs in FHE introduces a dramatic increase in computational complexity that requires optimized GPU kernels, along with managing terabyte-scale memory footprints that far exceed the capacity of a single GPU. This paper presents Cerium, a multi-GPU framework for FHE inference on large models. Cerium integrates a domain-specific language, an optimizing compiler, and a runtime system to automatically generate high-performance GPU kernels, manage terabyte-scale memory footprints, and parallelize computation across multiple GPUs. It introduces new IR constructs, compiler passes, sparse polynomial representations, memory-efficient data layouts, and communication-aware parallelization techniques that together enable encrypted inference for models ranging from small CNNs to Llama3-8B. We build Cerium on NVIDIA GPUs and demonstrate significant performance gains. For small models, Cerium outperforms expert-written hand-optimized GPU libraries by up to 2.25 times. Cerium achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art FHE ASICs, outright matching prior FHE ASIC CraterLake. It is the first GPU system to execute bootstrapping in under 10 milliseconds, achieving 7.5 milliseconds, and is the first to demonstrate encrypted inference for BERT-Base and Llama3-8B in 8 seconds and 134 seconds, respectively."}

This paper investigates the efficacy of 19 small, quantized LLMs (under 20 billion parameters) for the C to Java translation task. We use a novel, hybrid pipeline that leverages Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) for semantic decomposition and employs a highly constrained, rule based prompting strategy. The results are stark: a clear multi tiered performance divide emerged. The vast majority of models (Tier 3, e.g., llama3.1, gemma3, starcoder2) failed 100\\% of the tests, proving incapable of generating even basic, runnable Java boilerplate. A small middle tier (Tier 2, e.g., mistral-nemo and mistral) produced runnable code but was plagued by dangerous semantic failures and wrong translations. Only three models (Tier 1: phi4, deepseek-coder-v2, codeqwen) proved viable, passing over 50\\% of the test suite. Even these top models failed on the most complex C concepts, such as function pointers, sizeof, and enum logic, revealing a hard ceiling for the reasoning capabilities of current quantized models."}

To address this, we propose a novel multi-task learning (MTL) framework designed to jointly enhance accuracy and interpretability. Our architecture integrates a shared chemical language model with task-specific attention modules. By imposing an L1 sparsity penalty on these modules, the framework is constrained to focus on a minimal set of salient molecular fragments for each distinct toxicity endpoint. The resulting framework is trained end-to-end and is readily adaptable to various transformer-based backbones. Evaluated on the ClinTox, SIDER, and Tox21 benchmark datasets, our approach consistently outperforms both single-task and standard MTL baselines. Crucially, the sparse attention weights provide chemically intuitive visualizations that reveal the specific fragments influencing predictions, thereby enhancing insight into the model's decision-making process."}

These models are linked in the latent space using regression techniques, allowing efficient transitions between design and their associated sPGD modes. By empowering design exploration and optimization, this framework also advances digital and hybrid twin development, enhancing predictive modeling and real-time decision-making in engineering applications. The developed framework is demonstrated on two-phase microstructures, in which the multiparametric solutions account for variations in two key material parameters."}

LLMs are increasingly being used to process untrusted text inputs and even generate executable code, often while having access to sensitive system controls. To address these security concerns, several companies have introduced guard models, which are smaller, specialized models designed to protect text generation models from adversarial or malicious inputs. In this work, we advance the study of adversarial inputs by introducing Super Suffixes, suffixes capable of overriding multiple alignment objectives across various models with different tokenization schemes. We demonstrate their effectiveness, along with our joint optimization technique, by successfully bypassing the protection mechanisms of Llama Prompt Guard 2 on five different text generation models for malicious text and code generation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to reveal that Llama Prompt Guard 2 can be compromised through joint optimization.\n  Additionally, by analyzing the changing similarity of a model's internal state to specific concept directions during token sequence processing, we propose an effective and lightweight method to detect Super Suffix attacks. We show that the cosine similarity between the residual stream and certain concept directions serves as a distinctive fingerprint of model intent. Our proposed countermeasure, DeltaGuard, significantly improves the detection of malicious prompts generated through Super Suffixes. It increases the non-benign classification rate to nearly 100%, making DeltaGuard a valuable addition to the guard model stack and enhancing robustness against adversarial prompt attacks."}
