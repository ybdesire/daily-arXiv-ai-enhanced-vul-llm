Submitted to 'Logical and Symbolic Reasoning in Language Models @ AAAI 2026' conference and is under review", "summary": "Transformer-based language models display impressive reasoning-like behavior, yet remain brittle on tasks that require stable symbolic manipulation. This paper develops a unified perspective on these phenomena by interpreting self-attention and residual streams as implementing an approximate Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA). In this view, queries and keys define role spaces, values encode fillers, attention weights perform soft unbinding, and residual connections realize superposition of many bound structures. We use this algebraic lens to relate transformer internals to chain-of-thought traces, program-based reasoning, and memory-augmented tool use, and to explain characteristic failure modes such as variable confusion and inconsistency across logically related prompts. Building on this perspective, we propose VSA-inspired architectural biases, including explicit binding/unbinding heads and hyperdimensional memory layers, and training objectives that promote role-filler separation and robust superposition. Finally, we outline metrics for measuring \"VSA-likeness\" and logical compositionality, and pose theoretical and architectural open problems. Overall, the paper argues that viewing attention as soft vector-symbolic computation offers a principled route toward more interpretable and logically reliable reasoning systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5c06Transformer\u7684\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5411\u91cf\u7b26\u53f7\u67b6\u6784(VSA)\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u539f\u7406\u548c\u5931\u6548\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86VSA\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3Transformer\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u4e3a\u4f55\u5728\u7b26\u53f7\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f9d\u7136\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u4e3a\u5176\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u6d41\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3aVSA\u64cd\u4f5c\uff1a\u67e5\u8be2/\u952e\u5b9a\u4e49\u89d2\u8272\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u503c\u7f16\u7801\u586b\u5145\u7269\uff0c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6743\u91cd\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f6f\u89e3\u7ed1\uff0c\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u91cd\u7ed1\u5b9a\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u53e0\u52a0\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86Transformer\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3001\u7a0b\u5e8f\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u589e\u5f3a\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u53d8\u91cf\u6df7\u6dc6\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7b49\u5178\u578b\u5931\u6548\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u89c6\u4e3a\u8f6f\u5411\u91cf\u7b26\u53f7\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u539f\u5219\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

We bridge this gap by proposing a methodology for constructing benchmarks under KG incompleteness, which removes direct supporting triples while ensuring that alternative reasoning paths required to infer the answer remain. Experiments on benchmarks constructed using our methodology show that existing methods suffer consistent performance degradation under incompleteness, highlighting their limited reasoning ability. To overcome this limitation, we present the Adaptive Graph Reasoning Agent (GR-Agent). It first constructs an interactive environment from the KG, and then formalizes KGQA as agent environment interaction within this environment.

An Empirical Study of Dependency Amplification Across 10 Package Ecosystems", "comment": null, "summary": "Modern software development relies on package ecosystems where a single declared dependency can pull in many additional transitive packages. This dependency amplification, defined as the ratio of transitive to direct dependencies, has major implications for software supply chain security, yet amplification patterns across ecosystems have not been compared at scale. We present an empirical study of 500 projects across ten major ecosystems, including Maven Central for Java, npm Registry for JavaScript, crates io for Rust, PyPI for Python, NuGet Gallery for dot NET, RubyGems for Ruby, Go Modules for Go, Packagist for PHP, CocoaPods for Swift and Objective C, and Pub for Dart. Our analysis shows that Maven exhibits mean amplification of 24.70 times, compared to 4.48 times for Go Modules, 4.32 times for npm, and 0.32 times for CocoaPods. We find significant differences with large effect sizes in 22 of 45 pairwise comparisons, challenging the assumption that npm has the highest amplification due to its many small purpose packages. We observe that 28 percent of Maven projects exceed 10 times amplification, indicating a systematic pattern rather than isolated outliers, compared to 14 percent for RubyGems, 12 percent for npm, and zero percent for Cargo, PyPI, Packagist, CocoaPods, and Pub.

In the domain of chess, this standard manifests as accuracy benchmarks against strong engines like Stockfish. However, high scalar accuracy does not necessarily imply robust conceptual understanding. This paper argues that standard accuracy metrics fail to distinguish between genuine geometric reasoning and the superficial memorization of canonical board states. To address this gap, we propose a Geometric Stability Framework, a novel evaluation methodology that rigorously tests model consistency under invariant transformations-including board rotation, mirror symmetry, color inversion, and format conversion. We applied this framework to a comparative analysis of six state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT-5.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and Kimi K2 Turbo, utilizing a dataset of approximately 3,000 positions. Our results reveal a significant Accuracy-Stability Paradox. While models such as GPT-5.1 achieve near-optimal accuracy on standard positions, they exhibit catastrophic degradation under geometric perturbation, specifically in rotation tasks where error rates surge by over 600%. This disparity suggests a reliance on pattern matching over abstract spatial logic. Conversely, Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Kimi K2 Turbo demonstrate superior dual robustness, maintaining high consistency across all transformation axes. Furthermore, we analyze the trade-off between helpfulness and safety, identifying Gemini 2.5 Flash as the leader in illegal state rejection (96.0%).

However, the persistence of the implanted backdoors under user-driven post-deployment continual fine-tuning has been rarely examined. Most prior works evaluate the effectiveness and generalization of implanted backdoors only at releasing and empirical evidence shows that naively injected backdoor persistence degrades after updates. In this work, we study whether and how implanted backdoors persist through a multi-stage post-deployment fine-tuning. We propose P-Trojan, a trigger-based attack algorithm that explicitly optimizes for backdoor persistence across repeated updates. By aligning poisoned gradients with those of clean tasks on token embeddings, the implanted backdoor mapping is less likely to be suppressed or forgotten during subsequent updates. Theoretical analysis shows the feasibility of such persistent backdoor attacks after continual fine-tuning. And experiments conducted on the Qwen2.5 and LLaMA3 families of LLMs, as well as diverse task sequences, demonstrate that P-Trojan achieves over 99% persistence while preserving clean-task accuracy.

The abundance of protein sequence data, which can be readily represented as discrete tokens, has driven fruitful developments in protein language models (pLMs). A key remaining challenge, however, is how to effectively integrate continuous structural knowledge into pLMs. Current methods often discretize protein structures to accommodate the language modeling framework, which inevitably results in the loss of fine-grained information and limits the performance potential of multimodal pLMs. In this paper, we argue that such concerns can be circumvented: a sequence-based pLM can be extended to incorporate the structure modality through continuous tokens, i.e., high-fidelity protein structure latents that avoid vector quantization. Specifically, we propose a hybrid diffusion protein language model, HD-Prot, which embeds a continuous-valued diffusion head atop a discrete pLM, enabling seamless operation with both discrete and continuous tokens for joint sequence-structure modeling. It captures inter-token dependencies across modalities through a unified absorbing diffusion process, and estimates per-token distributions via categorical prediction for sequences and continuous diffusion for structures. Extensive empirical results show that HD-Prot achieves competitive performance in unconditional sequence-structure co-generation, motif-scaffolding, protein structure prediction, and inverse folding tasks, performing on par with state-of-the-art multimodal pLMs despite being developed under limited computational resources.

To quantify this, we introduce a new metric, reliable@k, and develop an automated pipeline that generates high-quality cousin prompts via data augmentation. Building upon this, we construct IFEval++ for systematic evaluation. Across 20 proprietary and 26 open-source LLMs, we find that current models exhibit substantial insufficiency in nuance-oriented reliability -- their performance can drop by up to 61.8% with nuanced prompt modifications.

However, constructing a reliable CKM demands substantial data and computation, and in dynamic environments, a pre-built CKM becomes outdated, degrading performance. Frequent retraining restores accuracy but incurs significant waste, creating a fundamental trade-off between CKM efficacy and update overhead. To address this, we introduce a Map Efficacy Function (MEF) capturing both gradual aging and abrupt environmental transitions, and formulate the update scheduling problem as fractional programming. We develop two Dinkelbach-based algorithms: Delta-P guarantees global optimality, while Delta-L achieves near-optimal performance with near-linear complexity. For unpredictable environments, we derive a threshold-based policy: immediate updates are optimal when the environmental degradation rate exceeds the resource consumption acceleration; otherwise, delay is preferable. For predictable environments, long-term strategies strategically relax these myopic rules to maximize global performance. Across this regime, the policy reveals that stronger entry loss and faster decay favor immediate updates, while weaker entry loss and slower decay favor delayed updates.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faMap Efficacy Function(MEF)\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3CKM\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86Delta-P\u548cDelta-L\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u6700\u4f18\u66f4\u65b0\u7b56\u7565", "motivation": "CKM\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9884\u5efa\u5730\u56fe\u4f1a\u8fc7\u65f6\uff0c\u9891\u7e41\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6062\u590d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f46\u9020\u6210\u663e\u8457\u6d6a\u8d39\uff0c\u5b58\u5728CKM\u6548\u80fd\u4e0e\u66f4\u65b0\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6743\u8861", "method": "\u5f15\u5165MEF\u6355\u83b7\u73af\u5883\u6e10\u53d8\u548c\u7a81\u53d8\uff0c\u5c06\u66f4\u65b0\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u516c\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u5206\u5f0f\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e24\u79cdDinkelbach-based\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u9608\u503c\u7b56\u7565", "result": "Delta-P\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u6027\uff0cDelta-L\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8fd1\u7ebf\u6027\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff1b\u9608\u503c\u7b56\u7565\u786e\u5b9a\u7acb\u5373\u66f4\u65b0\u6216\u5ef6\u8fdf\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6761\u4ef6", "conclusion": "\u7b56\u7565\u63ed\u793a\u5f3a\u5165\u53e3\u635f\u8017\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u8870\u51cf\u504f\u597d\u7acb\u5373\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5f31\u5165\u53e3\u635f\u8017\u548c\u6162\u8870\u51cf\u504f\u597d\u5ef6\u8fdf\u66f4\u65b0\uff1b\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u957f\u671f\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5168\u5c40\u6027\u80fd"}}

However, existing LLM reasoning strategies mainly rely on the LLM itself with fast or slow mode (like o1 thinking) and thus struggle to balance reasoning efficiency and accuracy across queries of varying difficulties. In this paper, we propose Cognitive-Inspired Elastic Reasoning (CogER), a framework inspired by human hierarchical reasoning that dynamically selects the most suitable reasoning strategy for each query. Specifically, CogER first assesses the complexity of incoming queries and assigns them to one of several predefined levels, each corresponding to a tailored processing strategy, thereby addressing the challenge of unobservable query difficulty. To achieve automatic strategy selection, we model the process as a Markov Decision Process and train a CogER-Agent using reinforcement learning.

We operationalize this practice through CAPE (Capability Achievement via Policy Execution), a protocol implementing a Specify -> Verify -> Correct -> Train loop.\n  CAPE is grounded in two empirical findings: (1) contextual objectivity, where properties appearing subjective become objective once context is fixed (inter-annotator agreement rises from kappa = 0.42 to kappa = 0.98), and (2) verification-fidelity scaling, where verification accuracy improves with model scale (r = 0.94), unlike preference agreement which plateaus at 30 to 50 percent disagreement regardless of compute. Across 109,500 examples in six domains, CAPE reduces violation rates by 81 percent relative to DPO (standard deviation less than 0.3 percent). By replacing per-example annotation with reusable specifications, CAPE reduces costs by 5 to 20 times and shortens timelines from months to weeks.\n  We release the CAPE protocol, PredicateGraph schema, CPL specification language, and policy packs under Apache 2.0.

Relaxed Decision Diagrams (DDs) provide a versatile mechanism for deriving such dual bounds by compactly over-approximating the solution space through node merging. However, the quality of these relaxed diagrams, i.e. the tightness of the resulting dual bounds, depends critically on the variable ordering and the merging decisions executed during compilation. While dynamic variable ordering heuristics effectively tighten bounds, they often incur computational overhead when evaluated globally across the entire variable set. To mitigate this trade-off, this work introduces a novel clustering-based framework for variable ordering. Instead of applying dynamic ordering heuristics to the full set of unfixed variables, we first partition variables into clusters. We then leverage this structural decomposition to guide the ordering process, significantly reducing the heuristic's search space. Within this framework, we investigate two distinct strategies: Cluster-to-Cluster, which processes clusters sequentially using problem-specific aggregate criteria (such as cumulative vertex weights in the Maximum Weighted Independent Set Problem (MWISP)), and Pick-and-Sort, which iteratively selects and sorts representative variables from each cluster to balance local diversity with heuristic guidance. Later on, developing some theoretical results on the growth of the size of DDs for MWISP we propose two different policies for setting the number of clusters within the proposed framework. We embed these strategies into a DD-based branch-and-bound algorithm and evaluate them on the MWISP. Across benchmark instances, the proposed methodology consistently reduces computational costs compared to standard dynamic variable ordering baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u6392\u5e8f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u53d8\u91cf\u5206\u7ec4\u4e3a\u805a\u7c7b\u6765\u7f29\u51cf\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u91cf\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5728\u6700\u5927\u52a0\u6743\u72ec\u7acb\u96c6\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u79bb\u6563\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u677e\u5f1b\u51b3\u7b56\u56fe(DD)\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u53d8\u91cf\u6392\u5e8f\u8d28\u91cf\u6765\u83b7\u5f97\u7d27\u81f4\u7684\u5bf9\u5076\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u4f46\u5168\u5c40\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u91cf\u6392\u5e8f\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u8fb9\u754c\u7d27\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u6743\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u805a\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5148\u5c06\u53d8\u91cf\u5206\u533a\u4e3a\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u518d\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\uff1a1) Cluster-to-Cluster\u57fa\u4e8e\u805a\u5408\u51c6\u5219\u987a\u5e8f\u5904\u7406\u805a\u7c7b\uff1b2) Pick-and-Sort\u8fed\u4ee3\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u53d8\u91cf\u3002\u9488\u5bf9MWISP\u95ee\u9898\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790DD\u5927\u5c0f\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u805a\u7c7b\u6570\u91cf\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5c06\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5d4c\u5165\u57fa\u4e8eDD\u7684\u5206\u652f\u5b9a\u754c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728MWISP\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4e00\u81f4\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u6392\u5e8f\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u8fb9\u754c\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u56fe\u7f16\u8bd1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In many applications, epistemic effects arising from uncertain parameters and model form dominate prediction error and strongly influence engineering decisions. Because distinguishing and representing each source separately is often infeasible, their combined effect is typically analyzed using a unified model-error framework. Model error directly affects model credibility and predictive reliability; yet its characterization remains challenging. To address this need, we introduce a bootstrap-based stochastic subspace model for characterizing model error in the stochastic reduced-order modeling framework. Given a snapshot matrix of state vectors, the method leverages the empirical data distribution to induce a sampling distribution over principal subspaces for reduced order modeling. The resulting stochastic model enables improved characterization of model error in computational mechanics compared with existing approaches. The method offers several advantages: (1) it is assumption-free and leverages the empirical data distribution; (2) it enforces linear constraints (such as boundary conditions) by construction; (3) it requires only one hyperparameter, significantly simplifying the training process; and (4) its algorithm is straightforward to implement. We evaluate the method's performance against existing approaches using numerical examples in computational mechanics and structural dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e bootstrap \u7684\u968f\u673a\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8bef\u5dee\u8868\u5f81", "motivation": "\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u524d\u5411\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u9700\u8981\u5904\u7406\u5076\u7136\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8bef\u5dee\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u53ef\u9760\u6027", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e bootstrap \u7684\u968f\u673a\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u5728\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u8bf1\u5bfc\u91c7\u6837\u5206\u5e03", "result": "\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u8868\u5f81\u8ba1\u7b97\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8bef\u5dee", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u5047\u8bbe\u81ea\u7531\u3001\u80fd\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u7ebf\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u53ea\u9700\u4e00\u4e2a\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u3001\u7b97\u6cd5\u6613\u5b9e\u73b0\u7b49\u4f18\u52bf"}}

While large language models (LLMs) offer a path to automation, their limited training on HDL code makes end-to-end transpilation brittle and prone to syntax errors. We compare two LLM-driven methods for syntax repair in a MATLAB-to-HDL pipeline: a structured, expert-designed flow that follows a fixed sequence of operations, and a more autonomous agentic approach that uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) \\cite{anthropic2024mcp} to dynamically select its own tools. We study 42 MATLAB signal-processing functions and isolate the syntax-repair stage. Across three model scales, the agentic approach is more effective at resolving initial syntax errors, unblocking a greater number of candidates to proceed through the pipeline. This upstream improvement yields measurable downstream improvements, most notably on mid-sized models, where it increases the simulation reach rate by over 20 percentage points. We hypothesize the gains come from short prompts, aggressive context management, and conditional tool use. Conditional retrieval helps at 8B and 30B; at 235B final-success gains are small and a naive RAG variant attains the highest final success. Our findings suggest that these agentic frameworks, when properly designed, are most effective at compensating for the capacity limits of small and mid-sized models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We term this iterative cycle of generation, evaluation, and refinement AI-Driven Research for Systems (ADRS). Using several open-source ADRS instances (i.e., OpenEvolve, GEPA, and ShinkaEvolve), we demonstrate across ten case studies (e.g., multi-region cloud scheduling, mixture-of-experts load balancing, LLM-based SQL, transaction scheduling) that ADRS-generated solutions can match or even outperform human state-of-the-art designs. Based on these findings, we outline best practices (e.g., level of prompt specification, amount of feedback, robust evaluation) for effectively using ADRS, and we discuss future research directions and their implications. Although we do not yet have a universal recipe for applying ADRS across all of systems research, we hope our preliminary findings, together with the challenges we identify, offer meaningful guidance for future work as researcher effort shifts increasingly toward problem formulation and strategic oversight.

As the prevalence of students utilizing AI for assignments increases, concerns regarding academic integrity and the validity of assessments are growing. This study utilizes the Earth Science I section of the 2025 Korean College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT) to deeply analyze the multimodal scientific reasoning capabilities and cognitive limitations of state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. Three experimental conditions (full-page input, individual item input, and optimized multimodal input) were designed to evaluate model performance across different data structures. Quantitative results indicated that unstructured inputs led to significant performance degradation due to segmentation and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) failures. Even under optimized conditions, models exhibited fundamental reasoning flaws. Qualitative analysis revealed that \"Perception Errors\" were dominant, highlighting a \"Perception-Cognition Gap\" where models failed to interpret symbolic meanings in schematic diagrams despite recognizing visual data.

In Vertical FL (VFL), where each party holds different features for the same users, a key challenge is to evaluate the feature contribution of each party before any model is trained, particularly in the early stages when no model exists. To address this, the Shapley-CMI method was recently proposed as a model-free, information-theoretic approach to feature valuation using Conditional Mutual Information (CMI). However, its original formulation did not provide a practical implementation capable of computing the required permutations and intersections securely. This paper presents a novel privacy-preserving implementation of Shapley-CMI for VFL. Our system introduces a private set intersection (PSI) server that performs all necessary feature permutations and computes encrypted intersection sizes across discretized and encrypted ID groups, without the need for raw data exchange. Each party then uses these intersection results to compute Shapley-CMI values, computing the marginal utility of their features. Initial experiments confirm the correctness and privacy of the proposed system, demonstrating its viability for secure and efficient feature contribution estimation in VFL. This approach ensures data confidentiality, scales across multiple parties, and enables fair data valuation without requiring the sharing of raw data or training models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5782\u76f4\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684Shapley-CMI\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7PSI\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5b89\u5168\u8ba1\u7b97\u7279\u5f81\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5171\u4eab\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u6216\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5782\u76f4\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u5404\u65b9\u7279\u5f81\u8d21\u732e\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662fShapley-CMI\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u9645\u5b89\u5168\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684Shapley-CMI\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u79c1\u6709\u96c6\u5408\u4ea4\u96c6\uff08PSI\uff09\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u6765\u6267\u884c\u7279\u5f81\u6392\u5217\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u52a0\u5bc6\u4ea4\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u5404\u65b9\u4f7f\u7528\u4ea4\u96c6\u7ed3\u679c\u8ba1\u7b97Shapley-CMI\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u521d\u6b65\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728VFL\u4e2d\u5b89\u5168\u9ad8\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u7279\u5f81\u8d21\u732e\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u673a\u5bc6\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u591a\u65b9\u4e4b\u95f4\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u5171\u4eab\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u6216\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4ef7\u503c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u521d\u6b65\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Existing benchmarks involve simple programs, failing to represent real-world complexities such as inter- or intra-procedural dependencies, core or third-party API calls, highly nested constructs, and non-primitive complex types. Evaluating LLMs under such a simplistic setting poses a significant threat to assumptions about their generalizability in practice. To enable a more realistic evaluation of code reasoning, this paper proposes RE2-Bench, a benchmark of 1,101 reasoning problems, including 195 drawn from mature real-world projects. RE2-Bench leverages static and dynamic program analysis to automatically serialize and deserialize compound, complex, and custom types in real-world code, going far beyond the primitive-only settings used in prior work.\n  A key feature of RE2-Bench is categorizing each reasoning problem as Easy or Hard via a principled majority-vote mechanism over nine interpretable code complexity metrics, resulting in two well-separated and semantically meaningful difficulty categories suitable for precise calibration of LLM reasoning ability. A comprehensive evaluation of six general-purpose and reasoning-oriented LLMs on two widely used code reasoning tasks -- input prediction and output prediction -- using RE2-Bench reveals a significant performance drop from Easy to Hard problems (51.50\\% for input prediction and 42.15\\% for output prediction), confirming that prior evaluations substantially overestimate the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86RE2-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b1101\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4f7f\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u4ee3\u8868\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u5dee", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u9759\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5206\u6790\u81ea\u52a8\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u548c\u53cd\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u5408\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e9\u4e2a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4ee3\u7801\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u7684\u591a\u6570\u6295\u7968\u673a\u5236\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u7c7b\u4e3a\u6613/\u96be", "result": "\u5bf96\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4ece\u6613\u5230\u96be\u95ee\u9898\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff08\u8f93\u5165\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0b\u964d51.50%\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0b\u964d42.15%\uff09", "conclusion": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4f30\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0cRE2-Bench\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6"}}

Reproducing these bugs is essential for their resolution, but it is extremely challenging due to the inherent nondeterminism of DL models and their tight coupling with hardware and software environments. According to recent studies, only about 3% of DL bugs can be reliably reproduced using manual approaches. To address these challenges, we present RepGen, a novel, automated, and intelligent approach for reproducing deep learning bugs. RepGen constructs a learning-enhanced context from a project, develops a comprehensive plan for bug reproduction, employs an iterative generate-validate-refine mechanism, and thus generates such code using an LLM that reproduces the bug at hand. We evaluate RepGen on 106 real-world deep learning bugs and achieve a reproduction rate of 80.19%, a 19.81% improvement over the state-of-the-art measure. A developer study involving 27 participants shows that RepGen improves the success rate of DL bug reproduction by 23.35%, reduces the time to reproduce by 56.8%, and lowers participants' cognitive load.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aRepGen\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u73b0\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60bug\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728106\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9ebug\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8680.19%\u7684\u590d\u73b0\u7387\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8619.81%\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u91cfbug\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u8f6f\u786c\u4ef6\u73af\u5883\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u624b\u52a8\u590d\u73b0\u7387\u4ec5\u4e3a3%\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "RepGen\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u542b\u6784\u5efa\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3001\u5236\u5b9a\u7efc\u5408\u590d\u73b0\u8ba1\u5212\u3001\u91c7\u7528\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u751f\u6210-\u9a8c\u8bc1-\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u751f\u6210\u590d\u73b0\u4ee3\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u5728106\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60bug\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0cRepGen\u8fbe\u523080.19%\u7684\u590d\u73b0\u7387\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u6548\u7387\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u8377\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "RepGen\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60bug\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Preventing such toxicity before it emerges requires a clear understanding of how harmful conversations unfold. However, most proactive moderation strategies are manual, requiring significant time and effort from community maintainers. To support more scalable approaches, we curate a dataset of 159 derailed toxic threads and 207 non-toxic threads from GitHub discussions. Our analysis reveals that toxicity can be forecast by tension triggers, sentiment shifts, and specific conversational patterns.\n  We present a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based framework for predicting conversational derailment on GitHub using a two-step prompting pipeline. First, we generate \\textit{Summaries of Conversation Dynamics} (SCDs) via Least-to-Most (LtM) prompting; then we use these summaries to estimate the \\textit{likelihood of derailment}. Evaluated on Qwen and Llama models, our LtM strategy achieves F1-scores of 0.901 and 0.852, respectively, at a decision threshold of 0.3, outperforming established NLP baselines on conversation derailment. External validation on a dataset of 308 GitHub issue threads (65 toxic, 243 non-toxic) yields an F1-score up to 0.797.

Our 130 total test cases reveal significant security disparities: AutoGen demonstrates a 52.3% refusal rate versus CrewAI's 30.8%, while model performance ranges from Nova Pro's 46.2% to Claude and Grok 2's 38.5%. Most critically, Grok 2 on CrewAI rejected only 2 of 13 attacks (15.4% refusal rate), and the overall refusal rate of 41.5% across all configurations indicates that more than half of malicious prompts succeeded despite enterprise-grade safety mechanisms.

To bridge this gap, we first conduct a systematic analysis of 1,367 papers published in FSE, ASE, and ICSE between 2022 and 2025, identifying key research topics, commonly used benchmarks, industrial relevance, and open-source availability. We then carry out an empirical survey across 17 organizations, collecting 282 responses on six prominent topics, i.e., program analysis, automated testing, code generation/completion, issue resolution, pre-trained code models, and dependency management, through structured questionnaires. By contrasting academic capabilities with industrial feedback, we derive seven critical implications, highlighting under-addressed challenges in software requirements and architecture, the reliability and explainability of intelligent SE approaches, input assumptions in academic research, practical evaluation tensions, and ethical considerations.

However, most commonly used frameworks to build BPMN+DMN models only allow designers to detect syntactical errors, thus ignoring semantic (behavioural) faults. This forces business processes designers to manually run single executions of their BPMN+DMN processes using proprietary tools in order to detect failures. Furthermore, how proprietary tools translate a BPMN+DMN process to a computer simulation is left unspecified. In this paper, we advance this state of the art by designing a tool, named BDTransTest providing: i) a translation from a BPMN + DMN process B to a Java program P ; ii) the synthesis and execution of a testing plan for B, that may require the business designer to disambiguate some input domain; iii) the analysis of the coverage achieved by the testing plan in terms of nodes and edges of B.

We introduce a scenario-grounded benchmark that evaluates LLMs across biology, chemistry, materials, and physics, where domain experts define research projects of genuine interest and decompose them into modular research scenarios from which vetted questions are sampled. The framework assesses models at two levels: (i) question-level accuracy on scenario-tied items and (ii) project-level performance, where models must propose testable hypotheses, design simulations or experiments, and interpret results. Applying this two-phase scientific discovery evaluation (SDE) framework to state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a consistent performance gap relative to general science benchmarks, diminishing return of scaling up model sizes and reasoning, and systematic weaknesses shared across top-tier models from different providers. Large performance variation in research scenarios leads to changing choices of the best performing model on scientific discovery projects evaluated, suggesting all current LLMs are distant to general scientific \"superintelligence\". Nevertheless, LLMs already demonstrate promise in a great variety of scientific discovery projects, including cases where constituent scenario scores are low, highlighting the role of guided exploration and serendipity in discovery.

DTs enable monitoring, simulation, prediction, and optimization to enhance decision making and operational efficiency. A key challenge in multi-layered, model-driven DTs is aligning heterogeneous models across abstraction layers, which can lead to semantic mismatches, inconsistencies, and synchronization issues. Existing methods, relying on static mappings and manual updates, are often inflexible, error-prone, and risk compromising data integrity. To address these limitations, we present a heterogeneous model alignment approach for multi-layered, model-driven DTs. The framework incorporates a flexibility mechanism that allows metamodels to adapt and interconnect seamlessly while maintaining semantic coherence across abstraction layers. It integrates: (i) adaptive conformance mechanisms that link metamodels with evolving models and (ii) a large language model (LLM) validated alignment process that grounds metamodels in domain knowledge, ensuring structural fidelity and conceptual consistency throughout the DT lifecycle. This approach automates semantic correspondences discovery, minimizes manual mapping, and enhances scalability across diverse model types.

While the value alignment literature has developed techniques for shaping AI values, less attention has been paid to how to determine, under uncertainty, when imperfect alignment is good enough to justify delegation. We argue that rational delegation requires balancing an agent's value (mis)alignment with its epistemic accuracy and its reach (the acts it has available). This paper introduces a formal, decision-theoretic framework to analyze this tradeoff precisely accounting for a principal's uncertainty about these factors. Our analysis reveals a sharp distinction between two delegation scenarios. First, universal delegation (trusting an agent with any problem) demands near-perfect value alignment and total epistemic trust, conditions rarely met in practice. Second, we show that context-specific delegation can be optimal even with significant misalignment. An agent's superior accuracy or expanded reach may grant access to better overall decision problems, making delegation rational in expectation. We develop a novel scoring framework to quantify this ex ante decision. Ultimately, our work provides a principled method for determining when an AI is aligned enough for a given context, shifting the focus from achieving perfect alignment to managing the risks and rewards of delegation under uncertainty.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u51b3\u7b56\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4f55\u65f6\u5e94\u5c06\u51b3\u7b56\u59d4\u6258\u7ed9AI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4ef7\u503c\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u884c\u52a8\u8303\u56f4\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4ef7\u503c\u5bf9\u9f50\u6587\u732e\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5982\u4f55\u5851\u9020AI\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5224\u65ad\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u662f\u5426\u8db3\u591f\u597d\u4ee5\u8bc1\u660e\u59d4\u6258\u51b3\u7b56\u5408\u7406\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u6b63\u5f0f\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u8003\u8651\u59d4\u6258\u65b9\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u59d4\u6258\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u59d4\u6258\u60c5\u666f\u7684\u660e\u663e\u533a\u522b\uff1a\u901a\u7528\u59d4\u6258\u9700\u8981\u8fd1\u4e4e\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u5b8c\u5168\u8ba4\u77e5\u4fe1\u4efb\uff08\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u7f55\u89c1\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u7279\u5b9a\u60c5\u5883\u59d4\u6258\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u4e8b\u524d\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u539f\u5219\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u60c5\u5883\u4e0bAI\u662f\u5426\u8db3\u591f\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5c06\u91cd\u70b9\u4ece\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b8c\u7f8e\u5bf9\u9f50\u8f6c\u5411\u7ba1\u7406\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u59d4\u6258\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u56de\u62a5\u3002"}}

However, most existing large language models (LLMs) decouple reasoning from verification: they either generate reasoning without explicit self-checking or rely on external verifiers to detect errors post hoc. The former lacks immediate feedback, while the latter increases system complexity and hinders synchronized learning. Motivated by human critical thinking, we propose Stepwise Think-Critique (STC), a unified framework that interleaves reasoning and self-critique at each step within a single model. STC is trained with a hybrid reinforcement learning objective combining reasoning rewards and critique-consistency rewards to jointly optimize reasoning quality and self-evaluation.

Exploring Dependency Update Patterns of Bundled JavaScript Packages on the Web", "comment": "Accepted on ICSE 2026", "summary": "Reusable software components, typically distributed as packages, are a central paradigm of modern software development. The JavaScript ecosystem serves as a prime example, offering millions of packages with their use being promoted as idiomatic. However, download statistics on npm raise security concerns as they indicate a high popularity of vulnerable package versions while their real prevalence on production websites remains unknown. Package version detection mechanisms fill this gap by extracting utilized packages and versions from observed artifacts on the web. Prior research focuses on mechanisms for either hand-selected popular packages in bundles or for single-file resources utilizing the global namespace. This does not allow for a thorough analysis of modern web applications' dependency update behavior at scale. In this work, we improve upon this by presenting Aletheia, a package-agnostic method which dissects JavaScript bundles to identify package versions through algorithms originating from the field of plagiarism detection. We show that this method clearly outperforms the existing approaches in practical settings. Furthermore, we crawl the Tranco top 100,000 domains to reveal that 5% - 20% of domains update their dependencies within 16 weeks. Surprisingly, from a longitudinal perspective, bundled packages are updated significantly faster than their CDN-included counterparts, with consequently up to 10 times fewer known vulnerable package versions included.

Attribution methods, which assign credit to input features, have proven effective for explaining the decision making of computer vision models. From these, context attributions have emerged as a promising approach for explaining the behavior of autoregressive LLMs. However, current context attributions produce incomplete explanations by directly relating generated tokens to the prompt, discarding inter-generational influence in the process. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce the Context Attribution via Graph Explanations (CAGE) framework. CAGE introduces an attribution graph: a directed graph that quantifies how each generation is influenced by both the prompt and all prior generations. The graph is constructed to preserve two properties-causality and row stochasticity. The attribution graph allows context attributions to be computed by marginalizing intermediate contributions along paths in the graph.

These digital replicas, often utilized as structured repositories of asset-related data, facilitate interoperability across diverse systems. However, extant approaches treat the AAS as a static information model, lacking support for dynamic service integration and system adaptation. The existing body of literature has not yet thoroughly explored the potential for integrating executable behavior, particularly in the form of containerized services, into or from the AAS. This integration could serve to enable proactive functionality. In this paper, we propose a submodel-based architecture that introduces a structured service notion to the AAS, enabling services to dynamically interact with and adapt AAS instances at runtime. This concept is implemented through the extension of a submodel with behavioral definitions, resulting in a modular event-driven architecture capable of deploying containerized services based on embedded trigger conditions. The approach is illustrated through a case study on a 3-axis milling machine.

This paper introduces a decision-oriented framework and reproducible methodology that together quantify residual risk, convert adversarial probe outcomes into financial risk estimates and return-on-control (RoC) metrics, and enable monetary comparison of layered defenses for LLM-based systems. A retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) service is instantiated using the DeepSeek-R1 model over a corpus containing synthetic personally identifiable information (PII), and subjected to automated attacks with Garak across five vulnerability classes: PII leakage, latent context injection, prompt injection, adversarial attack generation, and divergence. For each (vulnerability, control) pair, attack success probabilities are estimated via Laplace's Rule of Succession and combined with loss triangle distributions, calibrated from public breach-cost data, in 10,000-run Monte Carlo simulations to produce loss exceedance curves and expected losses. Three widely used mitigations, attribute-based access control (ABAC); named entity recognition (NER) redaction using Microsoft Presidio; and NeMo Guardrails, are then compared to a baseline RAG configuration. The baseline system exhibits very high attack success rates (>= 0.98 for PII, latent injection, and prompt injection), yielding a total simulated expected loss of $313k per attack scenario. ABAC collapses success probabilities for PII and prompt-related attacks to near zero and reduces the total expected loss by ~94%, achieving an RoC of 9.83.

This raises concerns about intellectual property compliance and the potential unauthorized use of license-restricted code. While membership inference (MI) techniques have been proposed to detect such unauthorized usage, their effectiveness can be undermined by semantically equivalent code transformation techniques, which modify code syntax while preserving semantic.\n  In this work, we systematically investigate whether semantically equivalent code transformation rules might be leveraged to evade MI detection. The results reveal that model accuracy drops by only 1.5% in the worst case for each rule, demonstrating that transformed datasets can effectively serve as substitutes for fine-tuning. Additionally, we find that one of the rules (RenameVariable) reduces MI success by 10.19%, highlighting its potential to obscure the presence of restricted code. To validate these findings, we conduct a causal analysis confirming that variable renaming has the strongest causal effect in disrupting MI detection. Notably, we find that combining multiple transformations does not further reduce MI effectiveness. Our results expose a critical loophole in license compliance enforcement for training large language models for code, showing that MI detection can be substantially weakened by transformation-based obfuscation techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u7b49\u6548\u4ee3\u7801\u8f6c\u6362\u6280\u672f\u5982\u4f55\u524a\u5f31\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u53d8\u91cf\u91cd\u547d\u540d\u89c4\u5219\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u68c0\u6d4b\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u8bb8\u53ef\u8bc1\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u6267\u884c\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u4ee3\u7801\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5927\u91cf\u4ee3\u7801\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u516c\u5f00\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u79c1\u6709\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u8fd9\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u548c\u672a\u7ecf\u6388\u6743\u4f7f\u7528\u8bb8\u53ef\u8bc1\u53d7\u9650\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5df2\u6709\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\u6280\u672f\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u6b64\u7c7b\u672a\u7ecf\u6388\u6743\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u8bed\u4e49\u7b49\u6548\u4ee3\u7801\u8f6c\u6362\u6280\u672f\u524a\u5f31\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u8bed\u4e49\u7b49\u6548\u4ee3\u7801\u8f6c\u6362\u89c4\u5219\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u89c4\u907f\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5bf9\u5355\u4e2a\u8f6c\u6362\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u6548\u679c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u56e0\u679c\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8f6c\u6362\u89c4\u5219\u5728\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ec5\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d1.5%\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8f6c\u6362\u540e\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u5fae\u8c03\u3002\u53d8\u91cf\u91cd\u547d\u540d\u89c4\u5219\u4f7f\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\u6210\u529f\u7387\u964d\u4f4e10.19%\uff0c\u56e0\u679c\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u5b9e\u53d8\u91cf\u91cd\u547d\u540d\u5bf9\u7834\u574f\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\u68c0\u6d4b\u5177\u6709\u6700\u5f3a\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u7ec4\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u8f6c\u6362\u4e0d\u4f1a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u4e49\u7b49\u6548\u4ee3\u7801\u8f6c\u6362\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u53d8\u91cf\u91cd\u547d\u540d\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u524a\u5f31\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u8bb8\u53ef\u8bc1\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u6267\u884c\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u6df7\u6dc6\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u4ee5\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Due to the generally vast number of endpoints, automated testing techniques, like fuzzing, are of interest.\n  This paper introduces WuppieFuzz, an open-source REST API fuzzer built on LibAFL, supporting white-box, grey-box and black-box fuzzing. Using an OpenAPI specification, it can generate an initial input corpus consisting of sequences of requests. These are mutated with REST-specific and LibAFL-provided mutators to explore different code paths in the software under test. Guided by the measured coverage, WuppieFuzz then selects which request sequences to send next to reach complex states in the software under test. In this process, it automates harness creation to reduce manual efforts often required in fuzzing. Different kinds of reporting are provided by the fuzzer to help fixing bugs.\n  We evaluated our tool on the Petstore API to assess the robustness of the white-box approach and the effectiveness of different power schedules. We further monitored endpoint and code coverage over time to measure the efficacy of the approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "WuppieFuzz\u662f\u57fa\u4e8eLibAFL\u7684\u5f00\u6e90REST API\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u767d\u76d2\u3001\u7070\u76d2\u548c\u9ed1\u76d2\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u80fd\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e8f\u5217\u5e76\u62a5\u544a\u7f3a\u9677", "motivation": "REST API\u7aef\u70b9\u66b4\u9732\u5e26\u6765\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6280\u672f\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u5e9e\u5927\u7684\u7aef\u70b9\u6570\u91cf", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528OpenAPI\u89c4\u8303\u751f\u6210\u521d\u59cb\u8f93\u5165\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7REST\u7279\u5b9a\u548cLibAFL\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\u5668\u63a2\u7d22\u4ee3\u7801\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u6307\u5bfc\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e8f\u5217\u9009\u62e9", "result": "\u5728Petstore API\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u767d\u76d2\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u529f\u7387\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e86\u7aef\u70b9\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u8986\u76d6\u7387", "conclusion": "WuppieFuzz\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684REST API\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u624b\u52a8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf"}}

Therefore, to understand and avoid these bad practices, this paper introduces the first systematic study of bad practices in smart contracts, delving into over 47 specific issues. Specifically, we propose SCALM, an LLM-powered framework featuring two methodological innovations: (1) A hybrid architecture that combines context-aware function-level slicing with knowledge-enhanced semantic reasoning via extensible vectorized pattern matching. (2) A multi-layer reasoning verification system connects low-level code patterns with high-level security principles through syntax, design patterns, and architecture analysis.

This has led to a push to offload computations to general purpose hardware accelerators such as GPUs and TPUs, and a renewed interest in designing problem-specific accelerators using FPGAs. However, the development process of these problem-specific accelerators currently suffers from the \"two-language problem\": algorithms are developed in one (usually higher-level) language, but the kernels are implemented in another language at a completely different level of abstraction and requiring fundamentally different expertise. To address this problem, we propose a new MLIR-based compiler toolchain that unifies the development process by automatically compiling kernels written in the Julia programming language into SystemVerilog without the need for any additional directives or language customisations. Our toolchain supports both dynamic and static scheduling, directly integrates with the AXI4-Stream protocol to interface with subsystems like on- and off-chip memory, and generates vendor-agnostic RTL. This prototype toolchain is able to synthesize a set of signal processing/mathematical benchmarks that can operate at 100MHz on real FPGA devices, achieving between 59.71% and 82.6% of the throughput of designs generated by state-of-the-art toolchains that only compile from low-level languages like C or C++. Overall, this toolchain allows domain experts to write compute kernels in Julia as they normally would, and then retarget them to an FPGA without additional pragmas or modifications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eMLIR\u7684Julia\u5230SystemVerilog\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3FPGA\u4e13\u7528\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u7684\"\u53cc\u8bed\u8a00\u95ee\u9898\"", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u8ba1\u7b97\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u957f\u548c\u4e13\u7528\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5f53\u524dFPGA\u5f00\u53d1\u5b58\u5728\u7b97\u6cd5\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e0e\u786c\u4ef6\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1MLIR\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u52a8\u6001/\u9759\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210AXI4-Stream\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5382\u5546\u65e0\u5173\u7684RTL\u4ee3\u7801", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9eFPGA\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0100MHz\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u73b0\u6709C/C++\u5de5\u5177\u94fe59.71%-82.6%\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\u4f7f\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u7528Julia\u7f16\u5199\u8ba1\u7b97\u5185\u6838\u5e76\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u5373\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u5230FPGA"}}

To minimize risks and impede remote compromise, sensitive systems can be physically isolated from external networks, forming an airgap. Yet, airgaps can still be infiltrated by capable adversaries gaining code execution. Prior research has shown that attackers can then attempt to wirelessly exfiltrate data across the airgap by exploiting unintended radio emissions. In this work, we demonstrate reversal of this link: malicious code execution on embedded devices can enable wireless infiltration of airgapped systems without any hardware modification. In contrast to previous infiltration methods that depend on dedicated sensors (e.g., microphones, LEDs, or temperature sensors) or require strict line-of-sight, we show that unmodified, sensor-less embedded devices can inadvertently act as radio receivers. This phenomenon stems from parasitic RF sensitivity in PCB traces and on-chip analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), allowing external transmissions to be received and decoded entirely in software.\n  Across twelve commercially available embedded devices and two custom prototypes, we observe repeatable reception in the 300-1000 MHz range, with detectable signal power as low as 1 mW. To this end, we propose a systematic methodology to identify device configurations that foster such radio sensitivities and comprehensively evaluate their feasibility for wireless data reception. Exploiting these sensitivities, we demonstrate successful data reception over tens of meters, even in non-line-of-sight conditions and show that the reception sensitivities accommodate data rates of up to 100 kbps. Our findings reveal a previously unexplored command-and-control vector for air-gapped systems while challenging assumptions about their inherent isolation.

This study evaluates both classical feature-based methods and deep learning approaches that transform binary executables into visual representations, specifically, grayscale byte plots, and employ convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for automated classification of packed and non-packed binaries. A diverse dataset of benign and malicious Portable Executable (PE) files, packed using various commercial and open-source packers, was curated to capture a broad spectrum of packing transformations and obfuscation techniques. Classical models using handcrafted Gabor jet features achieved intense discrimination at moderate computational cost. In contrast, CNNs based on VGG16 and DenseNet121 significantly outperformed them, achieving high detection performance with well-balanced precision, recall, and F1-scores.

However, the distributed nature of platoon coordination creates security vulnerabilities, allowing authenticated vehicles to inject falsified kinematic data, compromise operational stability, and pose a threat to passenger safety. Traditional misbehaviour detection approaches, which rely on plausibility checks and statistical methods, suffer from high False Positive (FP) rates and cannot capture the complex temporal dependencies inherent in multi-vehicle coordination dynamics. We present Attention In Motion (AIMformer), a transformer-based framework specifically tailored for real-time misbehaviour detection in vehicular platoons with edge deployment capabilities. AIMformer leverages multi-head self-attention mechanisms to simultaneously capture intra-vehicle temporal dynamics and inter-vehicle spatial correlations. It incorporates global positional encoding with vehicle-specific temporal offsets to handle join/exit maneuvers. We propose a Precision-Focused (BCE) loss function that penalizes FPs to meet the requirements of safety-critical vehicular systems. Extensive evaluation across 4 platoon controllers, multiple attack vectors, and diverse mobility scenarios demonstrates superior performance ($\\geq$ 0.93) compared to state-of-the-art baseline architectures. A comprehensive deployment analysis utilizing TensorFlow Lite (TFLite), Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX), and TensorRT achieves sub-millisecond inference latency, making it suitable for real-time operation on resource-constrained edge platforms.

However, these models are increasingly vulnerable to leakage and theft, highlighting the critical need for robust intellectual property protection. Model watermarking has emerged as an effective solution, with black-box watermarking gaining significant attention for its practicality and flexibility. Nonetheless, existing black-box methods often fail to better balance covertness (hiding the watermark to prevent detection and forgery) and robustness (ensuring the watermark resists removal)-two essential properties for real-world copyright verification. In this paper, we propose ComMark, a novel black-box model watermarking framework that leverages frequency-domain transformations to generate compressed, covert, and attack-resistant watermark samples by filtering out high-frequency information. To further enhance watermark robustness, our method incorporates simulated attack scenarios and a similarity loss during training. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse datasets and architectures demonstrate that ComMark achieves state-of-the-art performance in both covertness and robustness.
