This research presents a blockchain-anchored audit trail model enabling transparent, immutable, and automated inter-operator settlement. The framework leverages distributed ledger technology, smart contract automation, and cryptographic verification to establish a unified, tamper-proof transaction record. Empirical evaluation demonstrates 87 percent reduction in transaction fees, settlement cycle compression from 120 days to 3 minutes, and 100 percent audit trail integrity. Smart contract automation reduces manual intervention by 92 percent and eliminates 88 percent of settlement disputes. Market analysis indicates institutional adoption accelerated from 8 percent in 2020 to 52 percent by April 2024, with projected industry investment reaching 9.2 billion USD annually.

In real deployments, providers distribute a global model to many edge devices, where each client personalizes the model using private data. When a deletion request is issued, clients may ignore it or falsely claim compliance, and providers cannot check their parameters or data. This makes verification difficult, especially because personalized models must forget the targeted samples while preserving local utility, and verification must remain lightweight on edge devices.\n  We introduce ZK APEX, a zero-shot personalized unlearning method that operates directly on the personalized model without retraining. ZK APEX combines sparse masking on the provider side with a small Group OBS compensation step on the client side, using a blockwise empirical Fisher matrix to create a curvature-aware update designed for low overhead. Paired with Halo2 zero-knowledge proofs, it enables the provider to verify that the correct unlearning transformation was applied without revealing any private data or personalized parameters.\n  On Vision Transformer classification tasks, ZK APEX recovers nearly all personalization accuracy while effectively removing the targeted information. Applied to the OPT125M generative model trained on code data, it recovers around seventy percent of the original accuracy. Proof generation for the ViT case completes in about two hours, more than ten million times faster than retraining-based checks, with less than one gigabyte of memory use and proof sizes around four hundred megabytes.

CIDP breaks this deadlock by injecting physical-layer entropy via rapid antenna sidelobe modulation, enabling near-isochronous, low-overhead anonymous communication. CIDP jointly designs: (a) a Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty network controller that stabilizes queues and maximizes entropy injection; (b) a robust discrete-time Control Barrier Function (RaCBF) filter that provably enforces deterministic jitter bounds for real-time flows despite uncertainty; and (c) a convex Sidelobe Time Modulation (SLTM) optimization that spreads signals into the antenna null-space to mask transmissions. We explicitly augment the classical anonymity bound with a physical-layer equivocation term, showing that rapidly changing sidelobes contribute additional secrecy. Consequently, as the injected physical entropy grows, both latency and dummy overhead can approach zero for a fixed anonymity target. We provide full theoretical proofs of queue stability, barrier-set invariance, and SLTM convexity. Moreover, we quantitatively benchmark our SLTM design against recent LPI/LPD schemes, demonstrating significantly lower intercept probability for comparable overhead. High-fidelity MATLAB/NS-3 simulations and an FPGA prototype validate CIDP: results show approximately 40% larger anonymity sets and 100% compliance with sub-30 ms jitter (compared to a Tor-like baseline), with only about 5% throughput loss. We also outline a Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA) and FOCI-compliant supply-chain strategy. CIDP is the first architecture that simultaneously addresses strong anonymity, strict isochrony, and spectral efficiency with provable guarantees, making it highly relevant for sovereign JADC2 deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While deep learning offers promising alternatives, existing methods often struggle with flexibility and generalization, particularly on unstructured meshes, which significantly limits their practical applicability. To address these challenges, we propose PhysGTO, an efficient Graph-Transformer Operator for learning physical dynamics through explicit manifold embeddings in both physical and latent spaces. In the physical space, the proposed Unified Graph Embedding module aligns node-level conditions and constructs sparse yet structure-preserving graph connectivity to process heterogeneous inputs. In the latent space, PhysGTO integrates a lightweight flux-oriented message-passing scheme with projection-inspired attention to capture local and global dependencies, facilitating multilevel interactions among complex physical correlations. This design ensures linear complexity relative to the number of mesh points, reducing both the number of trainable parameters and computational costs in terms of floating-point operations (FLOPs), and thereby allowing efficient inference in real-time applications.

High-mix discrete manufacturing systems require jointly optimizing mid-term production planning and machine-level scheduling under heterogeneous resources and stringent delivery commitments. We address this problem with a profit-driven integrated framework that couples a mixed-integer planning model with a machine-level scheduling heuristic. The planning layer allocates production, accessory co-production, and outsourcing under aggregate economic and capacity constraints, while the scheduling layer refines these allocations using a structure-aware procedure that enforces execution feasibility and stabilizes daily machine behavior. This hierarchical design preserves the tractability of aggregated optimization while capturing detailed operational restrictions. Evaluations are conducted on a real industrial scenario. A flexible machine-level execution scheme yields 73.3% on-time completion and significant outsourcing demand, revealing bottleneck congestion. In contrast, a stability-enforcing execution policy achieves 100% on-time completion, eliminates all outsourcing, and maintains balanced machine utilization with only 1.9 to 4.6% capacity loss from changeovers. These results show that aligning planning decisions with stability-oriented execution rules enables practical and interpretable profit-maximizing decisions in complex manufacturing environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u603b\u4f53\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u673a\u5668\u7ea7\u8c03\u5ea6\u7684\u53cc\u5c42\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5236\u9020\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4f18\u5316\u751f\u4ea7\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u65f6\u4ea4\u4ed8\u3002", "motivation": "\u5236\u9020\u4f01\u4e1a\u5728\u591a\u54c1\u79cd\u3001\u5c0f\u6279\u91cf\u548c\u6025\u4ef6\u8ba2\u5355\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u96be\u4ee5\u5236\u5b9a\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u751f\u4ea7\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u6df7\u5408\u5ea6\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u5236\u9020\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u5229\u6da6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u89c4\u5212\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u673a\u5668\u7ea7\u8c03\u5ea6\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5206\u79bb\u89c4\u5212\u5c42\uff08\u751f\u4ea7\u5206\u914d\u3001\u534f\u540c\u751f\u4ea7\u3001\u5916\u5305\uff09\u548c\u8c03\u5ea6\u5c42\uff08\u6267\u884c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3001\u673a\u5668\u884c\u4e3a\u7a33\u5b9a\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff1a\u67d4\u6027\u6267\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b073.3%\u7684\u51c6\u65f6\u5b8c\u6210\u7387\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u5916\u5305\uff1b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5f3a\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0100%\u51c6\u65f6\u5b8c\u6210\u7387\u3001\u96f6\u5916\u5305\uff0c\u4e14\u6362\u578b\u9020\u6210\u7684\u4ea7\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u4ec5\u4e3a1.9-4.6%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c06\u89c4\u5212\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u6267\u884c\u89c4\u5219\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5236\u9020\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5229\u6da6\u6700\u5927\u5316\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4f18\u5148\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51c6\u65f6\u4ea4\u4ed8\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002"}}

Protecting PII data has become increasingly important in today's digital age, and several regulations have been formulated to ensure the secure exchange and management of sensitive personal data. However, at times some of these regulations are at loggerheads with each other, like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Cures Act; and this adds complexity to the already challenging task of Health Data compliance. As public concern regarding sensitive data breaches grows, finding solutions that streamline compliance processes and enhance individual privacy is crucial. We have developed a novel TRUsted Compliance Enforcement (TRUCE) framework for secure data exchange which aims to automate compliance procedures and enhance trusted data management within organizations. The TRUCE framework reasons over contexts of data exchange and assesses the trust score of users and the veracity of data based on corresponding regulations. This framework, developed using approaches from AI/Knowledge representation and Semantic Web technologies, includes a trust management method that incorporates static ground truth, represented by regulations such as HIPAA, and dynamic ground truth, defined by an organization's policies. In this paper, we present our framework in detail along with the validation against the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Data Usage Agreement (DUA) on CDC Contact Tracing patient data, up to one million patient records.

Effective verification requires both the retrieval of high-quality evidence and rigorous reasoning processes. In this paper, we propose a two-stage framework for health misinformation detection: Agreement Score Prediction followed by Multi-Agent Debate. In the first stage, we employ large language models (LLMs) to independently evaluate retrieved articles and compute an aggregated agreement score that reflects the overall evidence stance.

But this benchmark may overlap with model training data. If that is true, scores may reflect training recall, not issue-solving skill. To study this, we test two Claude models that frequently appear in top-performing agents submitted to the benchmark. We ask them to find relevant files using only issue text, and then issue text plus file paths. We then run the same setup on BeetleBox and SWE-rebench. Despite both benchmarks involving popular open-source Python projects, models performed 3 times better on SWE-Bench-Verified. They were also 6 times better at finding edited files, without any additional context about the projects themselves. This gap suggests the models may have seen many SWE-Bench-Verified tasks during training. As a result, scores on this benchmark may not reflect an agent's ability to handle real software issues, yet it continues to be used in ways that can misrepresent progress and lead to choices that favour agents that use certain models over strong agent design.

Existing approaches often treat crop interactions, such as legume-cereal complementarity, which implicitly or rely on static deterministic formulations that fail to guarantee resilience against market and climate volatility. To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-Layer Robust Crop Planning Framework (MLRCPF) that integrates spatial reasoning, temporal dynamics, and robust optimization. Specifically, we formalize crop-to-crop relationships through a structured interaction matrix embedded within the state-transition logic, and employ a distributionally robust optimization layer to mitigate worst-case risks defined by a data-driven ambiguity set. Evaluations on a real-world high-mix farming dataset from North China demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The framework autonomously generates sustainable checkerboard rotation patterns that restore soil fertility, significantly increasing the legume planting ratio compared to deterministic baselines. Economically, it successfully resolves the trade-off between optimality and stability.

While recent foundation models for echocardiography can achieve strong performance on individual perceptual subtasks such as view classification, segmentation, or disease prediction, they typically operate in isolation and do not provide a unified, clinically coherent assessment. In this work, we introduce Echo-CoPilot, a multi-view, multi-task agent that uses a large language model to orchestrate a suite of specialized echocardiography tools. Within a ReAct-style loop, the agent decomposes clinician queries, invokes tools for view recognition, cardiac structure segmentation, measurement and disease prediction, and report synthesis, and integrates their outputs into guideline-aware answers and narrative summaries. We evaluate Echo-CoPilot on the public MIMIC-EchoQA benchmark, where it achieves an accuracy of 50.8\\%, outperforming both general-purpose and biomedical video vision-language models.

However, existing methods and tools often struggle with the realities of scientific literature: long-context documents, multi-modal content, and reconciling varied and inconsistent fine-grained information across multiple publications into standardized formats. These challenges are further compounded when the desired data schema or extraction ontology changes rapidly, making it difficult to re-architect or fine-tune existing systems. We present SciEx, a modular and composable framework that decouples key components including PDF parsing, multi-modal retrieval, extraction, and aggregation. This design streamlines on-demand data extraction while enabling extensibility and flexible integration of new models, prompting strategies, and reasoning mechanisms.

Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether existing approaches can effectively leverage such hybrid queries, particularly in cross-language contexts. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study of representative code models and reveal three challenges: (1) insufficient semantic understanding; (2) inefficient fusion in hybrid code retrieval; and (3) weak generalization in cross-language scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose UniCoR, a novel self-supervised framework that learns Unified Code Representations framework designed to learn unified and robust code representations. Firstly, we design a multi-perspective supervised contrastive learning module to enhance semantic understanding and modality fusion. It aligns representations from multiple perspectives, including code-to-code, natural language-to-code, and natural language-to-natural language, enforcing the model to capture a semantic essence among modalities. Secondly, we introduce a representation distribution consistency learning module to improve cross-language generalization, which explicitly aligns the feature distributions of different programming languages, enabling language-agnostic representation learning. Extensive experiments on both empirical benchmark and large-scale benchmark show that UniCoR outperforms all baseline models, achieving an average improvement of 8.64% in MRR and 11.54% in MAP over the best-performing baseline. Furthermore, UniCoR exhibits stability in hybrid code retrieval and generalization capability in cross-language scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faUniCoR\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u6df7\u5408\u4ee3\u7801\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u4f4e\u6548\u548c\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u6cdb\u5316\u5f31\u4e09\u4e2a\u6311\u6218", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u67e5\u8be2\uff08\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00+\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u4ee3\u7801\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u4f4e\u6548\u548c\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u6cdb\u5316\u5f31\u7684\u95ee\u9898", "method": "1) \u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\u589e\u5f3a\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\uff1b2) \u8868\u793a\u5206\u5e03\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2dMRR\u63d0\u53478.64%\uff0cMAP\u63d0\u534711.54%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b", "conclusion": "UniCoR\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6df7\u5408\u4ee3\u7801\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b"}}

However, current work has been mainly focused on indoor, household scenarios. In this work, we present SimWorld-Robotics~(SWR), a simulation platform for embodied AI in large-scale, photorealistic urban environments. Built on Unreal Engine 5, SWR procedurally generates unlimited photorealistic urban scenes populated with dynamic elements such as pedestrians and traffic systems, surpassing prior urban simulations in realism, complexity, and scalability. It also supports multi-robot control and communication. With these key features, we build two challenging robot benchmarks: (1) a multimodal instruction-following task, where a robot must follow vision-language navigation instructions to reach a destination in the presence of pedestrians and traffic; and (2) a multi-agent search task, where two robots must communicate to cooperatively locate and meet each other. Unlike existing benchmarks, these two new benchmarks comprehensively evaluate a wide range of critical robot capacities in realistic scenarios, including (1) multimodal instructions grounding, (2) 3D spatial reasoning in large environments, (3) safe, long-range navigation with people and traffic, (4) multi-robot collaboration, and (5) grounded communication.

While datasets such as LMSYS-Chat-1M and WildChat capture real-world user-LLM conversations, few studies systematically explore the mechanisms of human-LLM collaboration in coding scenarios. What tortuous paths do users experience during the interaction process? How well do the LLMs follow instructions? Are users satisfied? In this paper, we conduct an empirical analysis on human-LLM coding collaboration using LMSYS-Chat-1M and WildChat datasets to explore the human-LLM collaboration mechanism, LLMs' instruction following ability, and human satisfaction. This study yields interesting findings: 1) Task types shape interaction patterns(linear, star and tree), with code quality optimization favoring linear patterns, design-driven tasks leaning toward tree structures, and queries preferring star patterns; 2) Bug fixing and code refactoring pose greater challenges to LLMs' instruction following, with non-compliance rates notably higher than in information querying; 3) Code quality optimization and requirements-driven development tasks show lower user satisfaction, whereas structured knowledge queries and algorithm designs yield higher levels. These insights offer recommendations for improving LLM interfaces and user satisfaction in coding collaborations, while highlighting avenues for future research on adaptive dialogue systems.

While ``Decomposition-and-Fill'' methods like Skeleton-of-Thought attempt to parallelize generation via external orchestration, they suffer from \\textit{coherence drift} due to the lack of cross-stream communication. In this work, we introduce the \\textbf{Parallel Decoder Transformer (PDT)}, a parameter-efficient architecture that embeds coordination primitives directly into the inference process of a frozen pre-trained model.\n  Instead of retraining the base model, PDT injects lightweight \\textit{Speculative Note Conditioning (SNC)} adapters that allow parallel decoding streams to synchronize via a shared, dynamic latent space. We formulate coordination as a \\textit{speculative consensus} problem, where sibling streams broadcast semantic ``notes'' to a global bus, gated by a learned verification head. We validate our approach on a 50,000-step curriculum using a frozen 20B-parameter backbone. Our results demonstrate that PDT achieves effective self-correction, reaching \\textbf{77.8\\% precision} in coverage prediction and recovering approximate serial semantics without modifying the trunk weights.

Specifically, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) have forced the community to focus on users' data privacy. Despite the vast amount of data on developer issues available in GitHub repositories, there is a lack of empirical evidence on the issues developers of Open Source Software discuss to comply with privacy legislation. Method: In this work, we examine such discussions by mining and analyzing 32,820 issues from GitHub repositories. We partially analyzed the dataset automatically to identify law user rights and principles indicated, and manually analyzed a sample of 1,186 issues based on the type of concern addressed. Results: We devised 24 discussion categories placed in six clusters: features/bugs, consent-related, documentation, data storing/sharing, adaptability, and general compliance. Our results show that developers mainly focus on specific user rights from the legislation (right to erasure, right to opt-out, right to access), addressing other rights less frequently, while most discussions concern user consent, user rights functionality, bugs and cookies management. Conclusion: The created taxonomy can help practitioners understand which issues are discussed for law compliance, so that they ensure they address them first in their systems.

Evaluation across various CNN and RNN variants-including pre-trained and custom models trained over IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi-shows that FLARE achieves over 98% F1-score in closed-world and up to 91% in open-world scenarios. These results reveal that CNN and RNN models leak distinguishable traffic patterns, enabling architecture fingerprinting even under realistic FL settings with hardware, software, and data heterogeneity.

We show that LLMs develop linear representations of user demographics within activation space, wherein stereotypically associated attributes are encoded along interpretable geometric directions. We first probe residual streams across layers of four open transformer-based LLMs (Magistral 24B, Qwen3 14B, GPT-OSS 20B, OLMo2-1B) prompted with explicit demographic disclosure. We show that the same probes predict demographics from implicit cues: names activate census-aligned gender and race representations, while occupations trigger representations correlated with real-world workforce statistics.

However, serverless cloud users remain vulnerable to various types of attacks, including micro-architectural side-channel attacks. These attacks typically rely on the physical co-location of victim and attacker instances, and attackers will need to exploit cloud schedulers to achieve co-location with victims. Therefore, it is crucial to study vulnerabilities in serverless cloud schedulers and assess the security of different serverless scheduling algorithms. This study addresses the gap in understanding and constructing co-location attacks in serverless clouds. We present a comprehensive methodology to uncover exploitable features in serverless scheduling algorithms and devise strategies for constructing co-location attacks through normal user interfaces. In our experiments, we successfully reveal exploitable vulnerabilities and achieve instance co-location on prevalent open-source infrastructures and Microsoft Azure Functions.

Current methods often rely on costly LLM-based techniques (e.g. annotating dataset differences) or dense embedding models (e.g. for clustering), which lack control over the properties of interest. We propose using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to create SAE embeddings: representations whose dimensions map to interpretable concepts. Through four data analysis tasks, we show that SAE embeddings are more cost-effective and reliable than LLMs and more controllable than dense embeddings. Using the large hypothesis space of SAEs, we can uncover insights such as (1) semantic differences between datasets and (2) unexpected concept correlations in documents. For instance, by comparing model responses, we find that Grok-4 clarifies ambiguities more often than nine other frontier models. Relative to LLMs, SAE embeddings uncover bigger differences at 2-8x lower cost and identify biases more reliably. Additionally, SAE embeddings are controllable: by filtering concepts, we can (3) cluster documents along axes of interest and (4) outperform dense embeddings on property-based retrieval. Using SAE embeddings, we study model behavior with two case studies: investigating how OpenAI model behavior has changed over time and finding \"trigger\" phrases learned by Tulu-3 (Lambert et al., 2024) from its training data.

Recent work suggests that both graph neural network (GNN)-based and transformer-based models, including large language models (LLMs), yield promising results when evaluated on curated benchmark datasets. These datasets are typically characterized by consistent data distributions and heuristic or partially noisy labels. In this study, we systematically evaluate two representative DL models-ReVeal and LineVul-across four representative datasets: Juliet, Devign, BigVul, and ICVul. Each model is trained independently on each respective dataset, and their code representations are analyzed using t-SNE to uncover vulnerability related patterns. To assess realistic applicability, we deploy these models along with four pretrained LLMs, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-o3-mini, GPT-4o, and GPT-5 on a curated dataset, VentiVul, comprising 20 recently (May 2025) fixed vulnerabilities from the Linux kernel. Our experiments reveal that current models struggle to distinguish vulnerable from non-vulnerable code in representation space and generalize poorly across datasets with differing distributions. When evaluated on VentiVul, our newly constructed time-wise out-of-distribution dataset, performance drops sharply, with most models failing to detect vulnerabilities reliably.

Internet of Things and Cloud computing integrated systems (IoT-Cloud) facilitate sensing, automation, and processing for these healthcare applications. While real-time response is crucial for alleviating patient emergencies, protecting patient privacy is extremely important in data-driven healthcare. In this paper, we propose a multi-layer IoT, Edge and Cloud architecture to enhance the speed of response for emergency healthcare by distributing tasks based on response criticality and permanence of storage. Privacy of patient data is assured by proposing a Differential Privacy framework across several machine learning models such as K-means, Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Naive Bayes. We establish a comprehensive threat model identifying three adversary classes and evaluate Laplace, Gaussian, and hybrid noise mechanisms across varying privacy budgets, with supervised algorithms achieving up to 86% accuracy. The proposed hybrid Laplace-Gaussian noise mechanism with adaptive budget allocation provides a balanced approach, offering moderate tails and better privacy-utility trade-offs for both low and high dimension datasets. At the practical threshold of $\\varepsilon = 5.0$, supervised algorithms achieve 82-84% accuracy while reducing attribute inference attacks by up to 18% and data reconstruction correlation by 70%. Blockchain security further ensures trusted communication through time-stamping, traceability, and immutability for analytics applications.

We introduce AgriRegion, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework designed specifically for high-fidelity, region-aware agricultural advisory. Unlike standard RAG approaches that rely solely on semantic similarity, AgriRegion incorporates a geospatial metadata injection layer and a region-prioritized re-ranking mechanism. By restricting the knowledge base to verified local agricultural extension services and enforcing geo-spatial constraints during retrieval, AgriRegion ensures that the advice regarding planting schedules, pest control, and fertilization is locally accurate. We create a novel benchmark dataset, AgriRegion-Eval, which comprises 160 domain-specific questions across 12 agricultural subfields.

As these companies become increasingly consequential, how do their transparency practices evolve? The 2025 Foundation Model Transparency Index is the third edition of an annual effort to characterize and quantify the transparency of foundation model developers. The 2025 FMTI introduces new indicators related to data acquisition, usage data, and monitoring and evaluates companies like Alibaba, DeepSeek, and xAI for the first time. The 2024 FMTI reported that transparency was improving, but the 2025 FMTI finds this progress has deteriorated: the average score out of 100 fell from 58 in 2024 to 40 in 2025. Companies are most opaque about their training data and training compute as well as the post-deployment usage and impact of their flagship models. In spite of this general trend, IBM stands out as a positive outlier, scoring 95, in contrast to the lowest scorers, xAI and Midjourney, at just 14. The five members of the Frontier Model Forum we score end up in the middle of the Index: we posit that these companies avoid reputational harms from low scores but lack incentives to be transparency leaders.

Utilising a pool of operators instead of a single operator to handle move operations within a neighbourhood remains promising, but an optimum or near optimum sequence of operators necessitates further investigation. One of the promising ideas is to generalise experiences and seek how to utilise it.

Our central conclusion is the alignment of the objectives to concrete design elements as countermeasures, whereas certain objectives and countermeasures have no or minimal interferences with each other.

NAC replaces dense projections with sparse sensory gates for key-query projections and a sparse backbone network with two heads for computing \\textit{content-target} and \\textit{learnable time-constant} gates, enabling efficient adaptive dynamics. NAC supports three attention logit computation modes: (i) explicit Euler integration, (ii) exact closed-form solution, and (iii) steady-state approximation. To improve memory intensity, we implemented a sparse Top-\\emph{K} pairwise concatenation scheme that selectively curates key-query interactions. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees, including state stability, bounded approximation errors, and universal approximation. Empirically, we implemented NAC in diverse domains, including irregular time-series classification, lane-keeping for autonomous vehicles, and industrial prognostics.

In this paper, we propose a novel interpretability framework to systematically analyze the internal mechanisms of VLMs, focusing on the functional roles of attention heads in multimodal reasoning. To this end, we introduce CogVision, a dataset that decomposes complex multimodal questions into step-by-step subquestions designed to simulate human reasoning through a chain-of-thought paradigm, with each subquestion associated with specific receptive or cognitive functions such as high-level visual reception and inference. Using a probing-based methodology, we identify attention heads that specialize in these functions and characterize them as functional heads. Our analysis across diverse VLM families reveals that these functional heads are universally sparse, vary in number and distribution across functions, and mediate interactions and hierarchical organization. Furthermore, intervention experiments demonstrate their critical role in multimodal reasoning: removing functional heads leads to performance degradation, while emphasizing them enhances accuracy. These findings provide new insights into the cognitive organization of VLMs and suggest promising directions for designing models with more human-aligned perceptual and reasoning abilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCogVision\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u89d2\u8272\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u4ecd\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790", "method": "\u5f15\u5165CogVision\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u9010\u6b65\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u63a2\u9488\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u529f\u80fd\u5934\u5177\u6709\u666e\u904d\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3001\u529f\u80fd\u548c\u5c42\u6b21\u7ec4\u7ec7\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5e72\u9884\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5b83\u4eec\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3VLMs\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u7ec4\u7ec7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6307\u660e\u4e86\u65b9\u5411"}}

Previous work (Triad) proposes protocols for TEEs to maintain a trustworthy time source by building a cluster of TEEs that collaborate with each other and with a remote Time Authority to maintain a continuous notion of passing time. However, such approaches still allow an attacker to control the operating system and arbitrarily manipulate their own TEE's perceived clock speed. An attacker can even propagate faster passage of time to honest machines participating in Triad's trusted time protocol, causing them to skip to timestamps arbitrarily far in the future.

By taking aspiration from international standards and Australia's National Framework for AI Assurance initiative, this work demonstrates that trustworthiness can be systematically incorporated (by engineering) into AI systems, ensuring the execution fabric remains verifiable, transparent, reproducible and under meaningful human control.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u4fe1AI\u7f16\u6392\u7684\u5341\u5927\u6807\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6cbb\u7406\u67b6\u6784\u5d4c\u5165AI\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u6267\u884c\u5c42\u9762", "motivation": "AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u91cd\u8981\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u4f5c\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u4f46\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u5236\u5ea6\u95ee\u8d23\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u65e5\u76ca\u6269\u5927\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTen Criteria for Trustworthy Orchestration AI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u4eba\u673a\u8f93\u5165\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3001\u5ba1\u8ba1\u548c\u6eaf\u6e90\u6027\u5230\u7edf\u4e00\u63a7\u5236\u9762\u677f\u67b6\u6784", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u8986\u76d6\u6574\u4e2aAI\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3001\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6cbb\u7406\u6846\u67b6", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u4fe1\u6027\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5de5\u7a0b\u65b9\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u878d\u5165AI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6267\u884c\u5c42\u9762\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u900f\u660e\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u73b0\u5e76\u5728\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u63a7\u5236\u4e0b"}}

This shift is driven by two parallel trends: the widespread individual adoption of LLMs by reviewers to manage workload (the \"Lazy Reviewer\" hypothesis) and the formal institutional deployment of AI-powered assessment systems by conferences like AAAI and Stanford's Agents4Science. This study investigates the robustness of these \"LLM-as-a-Judge\" systems (both illicit and sanctioned) to adversarial PDF manipulation. Unlike general jailbreaks, we focus on a distinct incentive: flipping \"Reject\" decisions to \"Accept,\" for which we develop a novel evaluation metric which we term as WAVS (Weighted Adversarial Vulnerability Score). We curated a dataset of 200 scientific papers and adapted 15 domain-specific attack strategies to this task, evaluating them across 13 Language Models, including GPT-5, Claude Haiku, and DeepSeek.

General Scene Adaptation for VLN (GSA-VLN) shifts the focus from zero-shot generalization to continual, environment-specific adaptation, narrowing the gap between static benchmarks and real-world deployment. However, current GSA-VLN frameworks exclude user feedback, relying solely on unsupervised adaptation from repeated environmental exposure. In practice, user feedback offers natural and valuable supervision that can significantly enhance adaptation quality. We introduce a user-feedback-driven adaptation framework that extends GSA-VLN by systematically integrating human interactions into continual learning. Our approach converts user feedback-navigation instructions and corrective signals-into high-quality, environment-aligned training data, enabling efficient and realistic adaptation. A memory-bank warm-start mechanism further reuses previously acquired environmental knowledge, mitigating cold-start degradation and ensuring stable redeployment. Experiments on the GSA-R2R benchmark show that our method consistently surpasses strong baselines such as GR-DUET, improving navigation success and path efficiency. The memory-bank warm start stabilizes early navigation and reduces performance drops after updates. Results under both continual and hybrid adaptation settings confirm the robustness and generality of our framework, demonstrating sustained improvement across diverse deployment conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u9988\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u5bfc\u822a\u9002\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ea4\u4e92\u6765\u589e\u5f3aGSA-VLN\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dGSA-VLN\u6846\u67b6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u73af\u5883\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u800c\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u9988\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9d\u8d35\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u9002\u5e94\u8d28\u91cf", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u9988\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5bfc\u822a\u6307\u4ee4\u548c\u7ea0\u6b63\u4fe1\u53f7\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u73af\u5883\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e93\u70ed\u542f\u52a8\u673a\u5236\u91cd\u7528\u5148\u524d\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u73af\u5883\u77e5\u8bc6", "result": "\u5728GSA-R2R\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86GR-DUET\u7b49\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5bfc\u822a\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e93\u70ed\u542f\u52a8\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e86\u65e9\u671f\u5bfc\u822a\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u9002\u5e94\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u901a\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754cVLN\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

A widely used approach is the ratio-of-densities method, which defines a time-indexed target path by reweighting probability-density trajectories from multiple models with positive, or in some cases, negative exponents. This construction, however, harbors a critical and previously unformalized failure mode: Marginal Path Collapse, where intermediate densities become non-normalizable even though endpoints remain valid. Collapse arises systematically when composing heterogeneous models trained on different noise schedules or datasets, including a common setting in molecular design where de-novo, conformer, and pocket-conditioned models must be combined for tasks such as flexible-pose scaffold decoration. We provide a novel and complete solution for the problem. First, we derive a simple path existence criterion that predicts exactly when collapse occurs from noise schedules and exponents alone. Second, we introduce Adaptive path Correction with Exponents (ACE), which extends Feynman-Kac steering to time-varying exponents and guarantees a valid probability path. On a synthetic 2D benchmark and on flexible-pose scaffold decoration, ACE eliminates collapse and enables high-guidance compositional generation, improving distributional and docking metrics over constant-exponent baselines and even specialized task-specific scaffold decoration models.

Federated unlearning has therefore emerged as a research frontier, aiming to remove a specific party's contribution from the learned model while preserving the utility of the remaining parties. However, most unlearning techniques focus on Horizontal Federated Learning (HFL), where data are partitioned by samples. In contrast, Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) allows organizations that possess complementary feature spaces to train a joint model without sharing raw data. The resulting feature-partitioned architecture renders HFL-oriented unlearning methods ineffective. In this paper, we propose REMISVFU, a plug-and-play representation misdirection framework that enables fast, client-level unlearning in splitVFL systems. When a deletion request arrives, the forgetting party collapses its encoder output to a randomly sampled anchor on the unit sphere, severing the statistical link between its features and the global model. To maintain utility for the remaining parties, the server jointly optimizes a retention loss and a forgetting loss, aligning their gradients via orthogonal projection to eliminate destructive interference.

To address this challenge, we propose EmerFlow, a novel LLM-empowered representation learning framework that generates distinctive embeddings for emerging items. It first enriches the raw features of emerging items through LLM reasoning, then aligns these representations with the embedding space of the existing recommendation model.

They ig- nore the entropy intervention during the RL sampling that can boost the performance of GRPO by improving the di- versity of responses. In this paper, we propose Selective- adversarial Entropy Intervention, namely SaEI, which en- hances policy entropy by distorting the visual input with the token-selective adversarial objective coming from the en- tropy of sampled responses. Specifically, we first propose entropy-guided adversarial sampling (EgAS) that formu- lates the entropy of sampled responses as an adversarial ob- jective. Then, the corresponding adversarial gradient can be used to attack the visual input for producing adversarial samples, allowing the policy model to explore a larger an- swer space during RL sampling. Then, we propose token- selective entropy computation (TsEC) to maximize the ef- fectiveness of adversarial attack in EgAS without distorting factual knowledge within VLMs. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets show that our proposed method can greatly improve policy exploration via entropy intervention, to boost reasoning capabilities.

Current protection methods are limited to passively degrading image quality, failing to achieve stable control. While Targeted Data Protection (TDP) offers a promising paradigm for active redirection toward user-specified target concepts, existing TDP attempts suffer from poor controllability due to snapshot-matching approaches that fail to account for complete learning dynamics. We introduce TAFAP (Trajectory Alignment via Fine-tuning with Adversarial Perturbations), the first method to successfully achieve effective TDP by controlling the entire training trajectory. Unlike snapshot-based methods whose protective influence is easily diluted as training progresses, TAFAP employs trajectory-matching inspired by dataset distillation to enforce persistent, verifiable transformations throughout fine-tuning.

In this work, we make the first attempt to build a medalist-level LLM agent for geometry and present InternGeometry. InternGeometry overcomes the heuristic limitations in geometry by iteratively proposing propositions and auxiliary constructions, verifying them with a symbolic engine, and reflecting on the engine's feedback to guide subsequent proposals. A dynamic memory mechanism enables InternGeometry to conduct more than two hundred interactions with the symbolic engine per problem. To further accelerate learning, we introduce Complexity-Boosting Reinforcement Learning (CBRL), which gradually increases the complexity of synthesized problems across training stages. Built on InternThinker-32B, InternGeometry solves 44 of 50 IMO geometry problems (2000-2024), exceeding the average gold medalist score (40.9), using only 13K training examples, just 0.004% of the data used by AlphaGeometry 2, demonstrating the potential of LLM agents on expert-level geometry tasks.

Although a range of clustering methods have been developed, most focus exclusively on intrinsic cellular structure and ignore the pivotal role of cell-gene associations, which limits their ability to distinguish closely related cell types. To this end, we propose a Refinement Contrastive Learning framework (scRCL) that explicitly incorporates cell-gene interactions to derive more informative representations. Specifically, we introduce two contrastive distribution alignment components that reveal reliable intrinsic cellular structures by effectively exploiting cell-cell structural relationships. Additionally, we develop a refinement module that integrates gene-correlation structure learning to enhance cell embeddings by capturing underlying cell-gene associations. This module strengthens connections between cells and their associated genes, refining the representation learning to exploiting biologically meaningful relationships.

Existing inference-time mitigation methods typically manipulate classifier-free guidance (CFG) or perturb prompt embeddings; however, they often struggle to reduce memorization without compromising alignment with the conditioning prompt.

CAPTAIN first applies frequency-based noise initialization to reduce the tendency to replicate memorized patterns early in the denoising process. It then identifies the optimal denoising timesteps for feature injection and localizes memorized regions. Finally, CAPTAIN injects semantically aligned features from non-memorized reference images into localized latent regions, suppressing memorization while preserving prompt fidelity and visual quality.

In this exploratory study, we evaluated advice on finance and health from GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro across user profiles of varying vulnerability. First, we demonstrate that evaluators must have access to rich user context: identical LLM responses were rated significantly safer by context-blind evaluators than by those aware of user circumstances, with safety scores for high-vulnerability users dropping from safe (5/7) to somewhat unsafe (3/7). One might assume this gap could be addressed by creating realistic user prompts containing key contextual information. However, our second study challenges this: we rerun the evaluation on prompts containing context users report they would disclose, finding no significant improvement. Our work establishes that effective user-welfare safety evaluation requires evaluators to assess responses against diverse user profiles, as realistic user context disclosure alone proves insufficient, particularly for vulnerable populations.

To investigate the effects of RL and thinking in a CXR VLM, we perform large-scale SFT on CXR data to build an updated RadVLM based on Qwen3-VL, followed by a cold-start SFT stage that equips the model with basic thinking ability. We then apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with clinically grounded, task-specific rewards for report generation and visual grounding, and run matched RL experiments on both domain-specific and general-domain Qwen3-VL variants, with and without thinking. Across these settings, we find that while strong SFT remains crucial for high base performance, RL provides additional gains on both tasks, whereas explicit thinking does not appear to further improve results.

General-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) shows promise but lacks domain-specific reliability. We evaluated the performance of CA-GPT, a novel large model deployed on an AI-OCT system, against that of the general-purpose ChatGPT-5 and junior physicians for OCT-guided PCI planning and assessment.\n  Methods: In this single-center analysis of 96 patients who underwent OCT-guided PCI, the procedural decisions generated by the CA-GPT, ChatGPT-5, and junior physicians were compared with an expert-derived procedural record. Agreement was assessed using ten pre-specified metrics across pre-PCI and post-PCI phases.\n  Results: For pre-PCI planning, CA-GPT demonstrated significantly higher median agreement scores (5[IQR 3.75-5]) compared to both ChatGPT-5 (3[2-4], P<0.001) and junior physicians (4[3-4], P<0.001). CA-GPT significantly outperformed ChatGPT-5 across all individual pre-PCI metrics and showed superior performance to junior physicians in stent diameter (90.3% vs. 72.2%, P<0.05) and length selection (80.6% vs. 52.8%, P<0.01). In post-PCI assessment, CA-GPT maintained excellent overall agreement (5[4.75-5]), significantly higher than both ChatGPT-5 (4[4-5], P<0.001) and junior physicians (5[4-5], P<0.05). Subgroup analysis confirmed CA-GPT's robust performance advantage in complex scenarios.\n  Conclusion: The CA-GPT-based AI-OCT system achieved superior decision-making agreement versus a general-purpose large language model and junior physicians across both PCI planning and assessment phases.

Prior corrective approaches, such as Self-RAG, CRAG, and Adaptive-$k$, typically address this by \\textit{adding} more context or pruning existing lists. However, simply expanding the context window often leads to \\textbf{context dilution}, where distractors crowd out relevant information. We propose \\textbf{SEAL-RAG}, a training-free controller that adopts a \\textbf{``replace, don't expand''} strategy to fight context dilution under a fixed retrieval depth $k$. SEAL executes a (\\textbf{S}earch $\\rightarrow$ \\textbf{E}xtract $\\rightarrow$ \\textbf{A}ssess $\\rightarrow$ \\textbf{L}oop) cycle: it performs on-the-fly, entity-anchored extraction to build a live \\textit{gap specification} (missing entities/relations), triggers targeted micro-queries, and uses \\textit{entity-first ranking} to actively swap out distractors for gap-closing evidence. We evaluate SEAL-RAG against faithful re-implementations of Basic RAG, CRAG, Self-RAG, and Adaptive-$k$ in a shared environment on \\textbf{HotpotQA} and \\textbf{2WikiMultiHopQA}. On HotpotQA ($k=3$), SEAL improves answer correctness by \\textbf{+3--13 pp} and evidence precision by \\textbf{+12--18 pp} over Self-RAG.

In realistic scenarios, variations across individuals, devices, environments, and time introduce significant distributional shifts for the same activities. Recent efforts attempt to solve this challenge by applying or adapting existing out-of-distribution (OOD) algorithms, but only in certain distribution shift scenarios (e.g., cross-device or cross-position), lacking comprehensive insights on the effectiveness of these algorithms. For instance, is OOD necessary to HAR? Which OOD algorithm performs the best? In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing HAROOD, a comprehensive benchmark for HAR in OOD settings. We define 4 OOD scenarios: cross-person, cross-position, cross-dataset, and cross-time, and build a testbed covering 6 datasets, 16 comparative methods (implemented with CNN-based and Transformer-based architectures), and two model selection protocols. Then, we conduct extensive experiments and present several findings for future research, e.g., no single method consistently outperforms others, highlighting substantial opportunity for advancement. Our codebase is highly modular and easy to extend for new datasets, algorithms, comparisons, and analysis, with the hope to facilitate the research in OOD-based HAR.

Existing human-in-the-loop approaches typically assume users begin with a clear, stable concept understanding to be able to provide high-quality supervision. In reality, users often start with a vague idea and must iteratively refine it through \"concept deliberation\", a practice we uncovered through structured interviews with content moderation experts. We operationalize the common strategies in deliberation used by real content moderators into a human-in-the-loop framework called \"Agile Deliberation\" that explicitly supports evolving and subjective concepts. The system supports users in defining the concept for themselves by exposing them to borderline cases. The system does this with two deliberation stages: (1) concept scoping, which decomposes the initial concept into a structured hierarchy of sub-concepts, and (2) concept iteration, which surfaces semantically borderline examples for user reflection and feedback to iteratively align an image classifier with the user's evolving intent. Since concept deliberation is inherently subjective and interactive, we painstakingly evaluate the framework through 18 user sessions, each 1.5h long, rather than standard benchmarking datasets.

While existing Safe Offline RL methods typically enforce soft expected-cost constraints, they do not guarantee forward invariance. Conversely, Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) provide rigorous safety guarantees but usually depend on expert-designed barrier functions or full knowledge of the system dynamics. We introduce Value-Guided Offline Control Barrier Functions (V-OCBF), a framework that learns a neural CBF entirely from offline demonstrations. Unlike prior approaches, V-OCBF does not assume access to the dynamics model; instead, it derives a recursive finite-difference barrier update, enabling model-free learning of a barrier that propagates safety information over time. Moreover, V-OCBF incorporates an expectile-based objective that avoids querying the barrier on out-of-distribution actions and restricts updates to the dataset-supported action set. The learned barrier is then used with a Quadratic Program (QP) formulation to synthesize real-time safe control. Across multiple case studies, V-OCBF yields substantially fewer safety violations than baseline methods while maintaining strong task performance, highlighting its scalability for offline synthesis of safety-critical controllers without online interaction or hand-engineered barriers.", "AI": {"tldr": "V-OCBF\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece\u79bb\u7ebf\u6f14\u793a\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u795e\u7ecf\u63a7\u5236\u969c\u788d\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u4eba\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u969c\u788d\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9012\u5f52\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u969c\u788d\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u671f\u671b\u503c\u76ee\u6807\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u63a7\u5236\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u786e\u4fdd\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u9700\u8981\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5728\u7ebf\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6ee1\u8db3\u786c\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u6267\u884c\u8f6f\u671f\u671b\u6210\u672c\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u524d\u5411\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u3002\u800c\u63a7\u5236\u969c\u788d\u51fd\u6570\uff08CBFs\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u969c\u788d\u51fd\u6570\u6216\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "V-OCBF\u6846\u67b6\u4ece\u79bb\u7ebf\u6f14\u793a\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u795e\u7ecf\u63a7\u5236\u969c\u788d\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u9012\u5f52\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u969c\u788d\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u671f\u671b\u503c\u7684\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e0a\u67e5\u8be2\u969c\u788d\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u66f4\u65b0\u9650\u5236\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u652f\u6301\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u96c6\u5185\u3002\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u969c\u788d\u51fd\u6570\u4e0e\u4e8c\u6b21\u89c4\u5212\uff08QP\uff09\u516c\u5f0f\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5408\u6210\u5b9e\u65f6\u5b89\u5168\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "V-OCBF\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ea7\u751f\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8fdd\u89c4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "V-OCBF\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u8fdd\u89c4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u5728\u7ebf\u4ea4\u4e92\u6216\u4eba\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u969c\u788d\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u79bb\u7ebf\u5408\u6210\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}
