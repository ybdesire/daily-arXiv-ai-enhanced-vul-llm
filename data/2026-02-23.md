Abstract: Sea ice dynamics are crucial to the global climate system, yet traditional continuum (e.g., viscous-plastic) models often fail to represent the discrete floe interactions that dominate in the marginal ice zone. Lagrangian discrete element methods (DEMs) resolve floe-scale physics more realistically, but their high particle counts make ensemble data assimilation (DA) more expensive. We consider a highly-simplified floe model and propose a scalable, domain-decomposed DA framework that couples Lagrangian particle observations with an ensemble transform Kalman filter (ETKF) to recover the underlying ocean flow field in a multiscale setting. The Eulerian domain is first partitioned into subdomains. We then impose an ETKF in each subdomain to recover the local fine-scale ocean features. A Gaussian-weighted blending step then reconstructs a globally consistent flow field across subdomain boundaries. Numerical experiments demonstrate consistently better skill scores that are characterised by normalised root mean square error (NRMSE) and pattern correlation coefficients (PCC), compared to the global and expensive DA baseline. Results suggest that the domain-decomposed DA method is an alternative, scalable approach for particle-based sea-ice floe dynamics and ocean flow recovery.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Accurate, real-time, yet non-destructive estimation of internal states in lithium-ion batteries is critical for predicting degradation, optimizing usage strategies, and extending operational lifespan. Here, we introduce PINEAPPLE (Physics-Informed Neuro-Evolution Algorithm for Prognostic Parameter inference in Lithium-ion battery Electrodes), a novel framework that integrates physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with an evolutionary search algorithm to enable rapid, scalable, and interpretable parameter inference with potential for application to next-generation batteries. The meta-learned PINN utilizes fundamental physics principles to achieve accurate zero-shot prediction of electrode behavior with test errors below 0.1$\%$ while maintaining an order-of-magnitude speed-up over conventional solvers. PINEAPPLE demonstrates robust parameter inference solely from voltage-time discharge curves across multiple batteries from the open-source CALCE repository, recovering the evolution of key internal state parameters such as Li-ion diffusion coefficients across usage cycles. Notably, the inferred cycle-dependent evolution of these parameters exhibit consistent trends across different batteries without any customized degradation physics-embedded heuristic, highlighting the effective regularizing effect and robustness that can be conferred through incorporation of fundamental physics in PINEAPPLE. By enabling computationally efficient, real-time parameter estimation, PINEAPPLE offers a promising route towards the non-destructive, physics-based characterization of inter-cell and intra-cell variability of battery modules and battery packs, thereby unlocking new opportunities for downstream on-the-fly needs in next-generation battery management systems such as individual cell-scale state-of-health diagnostics.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The quadrature of cut elements is crucial for all Finite Element Methods that do not apply boundary-fitted meshes. It should be efficient, accurate, and robust. Various approaches balancing these requirements have been published, with some available as open-source implementations. This work reviews these open-sources codes and the methods used. Furthermore, benchmarking examples are developed for 2D and 3D geometries. Implicit and explicit boundary descriptions are available for all models. The different examples test the efficiency, accuracy, versatility, and robustness of the codes. Special focus is set on the influence of the input parameter, which controls the desired quadrature order, on the actual integration error. A detailed comparison of the discussed codes is carried out. The benchmarking allows a conclusive comparison and presents a valuable tool for future code development. All tests are published in an accompanying open-source repository.

Abstract: Manufacturing automation in process planning, inspection planning, and digital-thread integration depends on a unified specification that binds the geometric features of a 3D CAD model to the geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T) callouts, datum definitions, and surface requirements carried by the corresponding 2D engineering drawing. Although Model-Based Definition (MBD) allows such specifications to be embedded directly in 3D models, 2D drawings remain the primary carrier of manufacturing intent in automotive, aerospace, shipbuilding, and heavy-machinery industries. Correctly linking drawing annotations to the corresponding 3D features is difficult because of contextual ambiguity, repeated feature patterns, and the need for transparent and traceable decisions. This paper presents a deterministic-first, context-aware framework that maps 2D drawing entities to 3D CAD features to produce a unified manufacturing specification. Drawing callouts are first semantically enriched and then scored against candidate features using an interpretable metric that combines type compatibility, tolerance-aware dimensional agreement, and conservative context consistency, along with engineering-domain heuristics. When deterministic scoring cannot resolve an ambiguity, the system escalates to multimodal and constrained large-language-model reasoning, followed by a single human-in-the-loop (HITL) review step. Experiments on 20 real CAD-drawing pairs achieve a mean precision of 83.67%, recall of 90.46%, and F1 score of 86.29%. An ablation study shows that each pipeline component contributes to overall accuracy, with the full system outperforming all reduced variants. By prioritizing deterministic rules, clear decision tracking, and retaining unresolved cases for human review, the framework provides a practical foundation for downstream manufacturing automation in real-world industrial environments.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Agile estimation techniques, particularly T-shirt sizing, are widely used in software development for their simplicity and utility in scoping work. However, when we apply these methods to artificial intelligence initiatives -- especially those involving large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent systems -- the results can be systematically misleading. This paper shares an evidence-backed analysis of five foundational assumptions we often make during T-shirt sizing. While these assumptions usually hold true for traditional software, they tend to fail in AI contexts: (1) linear effort scaling, (2) repeatability from prior experience, (3) effort-duration fungibility, (4) task decomposability, and (5) deterministic completion criteria. Drawing on recent research into multi-agent system failures, scaling principles, and the inherent unreliability of multi-turn conversations, we show how AI development breaks these rules. We see this through non-linear performance jumps, complex interaction surfaces, and "tight coupling" where a small change in data cascades through the entire stack. To help teams navigate this, we propose Checkpoint Sizing: a more human-centric, iterative approach that uses explicit decision gates where scope and feasibility are reassessed based on what we learn during development, rather than what we assumed at the start. This paper is intended for engineering managers, technical leads, and product owners responsible for planning and delivering AI initiatives.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: As developers increasingly rely on LLM-generated code summaries for documentation, testing, and review, it is important to study whether these summaries accurately reflect what the program actually does. LLMs often produce confident descriptions of what the code looks like it should do (intent), while missing subtle edge cases or logic changes that define what it actually does (behavior). We present a mutation-based evaluation methodology that directly tests whether a summary truly matches the code's logic. Our approach generates a summary, injects a targeted mutation into the code, and checks if the LLM updates its summary to reflect the new behavior. We validate it through three experiments totalling 624 mutation-summary evaluations across 62 programs. First, on 12 controlled synthetic programs with 324 mutations varying in type (statement, value, decision) and location (beginning, middle, end). We find that summary accuracy decreases sharply with complexity from 76.5% for single functions to 17.3% for multi-threaded systems, while mutation type and location exhibit weaker effects. Second, testing 150 mutated samples on 50 human-written programs from the Less Basic Python Problems (LBPP) dataset confirms the same failure patterns persist as models often describe algorithmic intent rather than actual mutated behavior with a summary accuracy rate of 49.3%. Furthermore, while a comparison between GPT-4 and GPT-5.2 shows a substantial performance leap (from 49.3% to 85.3%) and an improved ability to identify mutations as "bugs", both models continue to struggle with distinguishing implementation details from standard algorithmic patterns. This work establishes mutation analysis as a systematic approach for assessing whether LLM-generated summaries reflect program behavior rather than superficial textual patterns.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Web accessibility remains an unresolved issue for a large part of the web content. There are many tools to detect errors automatically, but fixing those issues is still mostly a manual, slow, and costly process in which it is easy for developers to overlook specific details. The situation becomes even more complex with modern Single-Page Applications (SPAs), whose dynamic nature makes traditional static analysis approaches inadequate. This work proposes a system that aims to address this challenge by using Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate accessibility fixes. The proposal presents a modular workflow applicable to both static websites and complex Angular projects. The framework actively implements corrections within the DOM of static web pages or the source code of SPAs. The system was tested on 12 static websites and 6 open-source Angular projects, fixing 80% of the accessibility issues on public websites and 86% of the issues on Angular applications. Our proposal also generates meaningful visual descriptions for images while preserving the application's design and stability. This work contributes to ensuring that accessibility stops being a technical debt deferred to the future and becomes a natural part of everyday development workflows.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) increasingly automates various parts of the software development tasks. Although AI has enhanced the productivity of development tasks, it remains unstudied whether AI essentially outperforms humans in type-related programming tasks, such as employing type constructs properly for type safety, during its tasks. Moreover, there is no systematic study that evaluates whether AI agents overuse or misuse the type constructs under the complicated type systems to the same extent as humans. In this study, we present the first empirical analysis to answer these questions in the domain of TypeScript projects. Our findings show that, in contrast to humans, AI agents are 9x more prone to use the 'any' keyword. In addition, we observed that AI agents use advanced type constructs, including those that ignore type checks, more often compared to humans. Surprisingly, even with all these issues, Agentic pull requests (PRs) have 1.8x higher acceptance rates compared to humans for TypeScript. We encourage software developers to carefully confirm the type safety of their codebases whenever they coordinate with AI agents in the development process.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The increasing use of language models in automated software testing raises concerns about their environmental impact, yet existing sustainability analyses focus almost exclusively on large language models. As a result, the energy and carbon characteristics of small language models (SLMs) during test generation remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, this work introduces the DeCEAT framework, which systematically evaluates the environmental and performance trade-offs of SLMs using the HumanEval benchmark and adaptive prompt variants (based on the Anthropic template). The framework quantifies emission and time-aware behavior under controlled conditions, with CodeCarbon measuring energy consumption and carbon emissions, and unit test coverage assessing the quality of generated tests. Our results show that different SLMs exhibit distinct sustainability strengths: some prioritize lower energy use and faster execution, while others maintain higher stability or accuracy under carbon constraints. These findings demonstrate that sustainability in the generation of SLM-driven tests is multidimensional and strongly shaped by prompt design. This work provides a focused sustainability evaluation framework specifically tailored to automated SLM-based test generation, clarifying how prompt structure and model choice jointly influence environmental and performance outcomes.

Abstract: Automotive software increasingly outpaces hardware availability, forcing late integration and expensive hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) bottlenecks. The InnoRegioChallenge project investigated whether a virtual test and integration environment can reproduce electronic control unit (ECU) behavior early enough to run real software binaries before physical hardware exists. We report a prototype that generates instruction-accurate processor models in SystemC/TLM~2.0 using an agentic, feedback-driven workflow coupled to a reference simulator via the GNU Debugger (GDB). The results indicate that the most critical technical risk -- CPU behavioral fidelity -- can be reduced through automated differential testing and iterative model correction. We summarize the architecture, the agentic modeling loop, and project outcomes, and we extrapolate plausible technical details consistent with the reported qualitative findings. While cloud-scale deployment and full toolchain integration remain future work, the prototype demonstrates a viable shift-left path for virtual ECU twins, enabling reproducible tests, non-intrusive tracing, and fault-injection campaigns aligned with safety standards.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The adoption of Generative AI (GenAI) suggests major changes for software engineering, including technical aspects but also human aspects of the professionals involved. One of these aspects is how individuals perceive themselves regarding their work, i.e., their work identity, and the processes they perform to form, adapt and reject these identities, i.e., identity work. Existent studies provide evidence of such identity work of software professionals triggered by the adoption of GenAI, however they do not consider differences among diverse roles, such as developers and testers. In this paper, we argue the need for considering the role as a factor defining the identity work of software professionals. To support our claim, we review some studies regarding different roles and also recent studies on how to adopt GenAI in software engineering. Then, we propose a research agenda to better understand how the role influences identity work of software professionals triggered by the adoption of GenAI, and, based on that, to propose new artifacts to support this adoption. We also discuss the potential implications for practice of the results to be obtained.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: With the rapid improvement of LLMs' coding capabilities, the bottleneck of LLM-based automated software development is shifting from generating correct code to eliciting users' requirements. Despite growing interest, the interview competence of LLMs in conversational requirements elicitation remains fully underexplored. Existing evaluations often depend on a few scenarios, real user interaction, and subjective human scoring, which hinders systematic and quantitative comparison. To address these challenges, we propose ReqElicitGym, an interactive and automatic evaluation environment for assessing interview competence in conversational requirements elicitation. Specifically, ReqElicitGym introduces a new evaluation dataset and designs both an interactive oracle user and a task evaluator. The dataset contains 101 website requirements elicitation scenarios spanning 10 application types. Both the oracle user and the task evaluator achieve high agreement with real users and expert judgment. Using our ReqElicitGym, any automated conversational requirements elicitation approach (e.g., LLM-based agents) can be evaluated in a reproducible and quantitative manner through interaction with the environment. Based on our ReqElicitGym, we conduct a systematic empirical study on seven representative LLMs, and the results show that current LLMs still exhibit limited interview competence in uncovering implicit requirements. Particularly, they elicit less than half of the users' implicit requirements, and their effective elicitation questions often emerge in later turns of the dialogue. Besides, we found LLMs can elicit interaction and content implicit requirements, but consistently struggle with style-related requirements. We believe ReqElicitGym will facilitate the evaluation and development of automated conversational requirements elicitation.

Abstract: Large language models have achieved striking results in interactive theorem proving, particularly in Lean. However, most benchmarks for LLM-based proof automation are drawn from mathematics in the Mathlib ecosystem, whereas proofs in software verification are developed inside definition-rich codebases with substantial project-specific libraries. We introduce VeriSoftBench, a benchmark of 500 Lean 4 proof obligations drawn from open-source formal-methods developments and packaged to preserve realistic repository context and cross-file dependencies. Our evaluation of frontier LLMs and specialized provers yields three observations. First, provers tuned for Mathlib-style mathematics transfer poorly to this repository-centric setting. Second, success is strongly correlated with transitive repository dependence: tasks whose proofs draw on large, multi-hop dependency closures are less likely to be solved. Third, providing curated context restricted to a proof's dependency closure improves performance relative to exposing the full repository, but nevertheless leaves substantial room for improvement. Our benchmark and evaluation suite are released at https://github.com/utopia-group/VeriSoftBench.

Abstract: The quality assessment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems is a fundamental challenge due to their inherently probabilistic nature. Standards such as ISO/IEC 25059 provide a quality model, but they lack practical and statistically robust methods for assessing functional correctness. This paper proposes and evaluates the Statistical Confidence in Functional Correctness (SCFC) approach, which seeks to fill this gap by connecting business requirements to a measure of statistical confidence that considers both the model's average performance and its variability. The approach consists of four steps: defining quantitative specification limits, performing stratified and probabilistic sampling, applying bootstrapping to estimate a confidence interval for the performance metric, and calculating a capability index as a final indicator. The approach was evaluated through a case study on two real-world AI systems in industry involving interviews with AI experts. Valuable insights were collected from the experts regarding the utility, ease of use, and intention to adopt the methodology in practical scenarios. We conclude that the proposed approach is a feasible and valuable way to operationalize the assessment of functional correctness, moving the evaluation from a point estimate to a statement of statistical confidence.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Intent-based cross-chain bridges have emerged as an alternative to traditional interoperability protocols by allowing off-chain entities (\emph{solvers}) to immediately fulfill users' orders by fronting their own liquidity. While improving user experience, this approach introduces new systemic risks, such as solver liquidity concentration and delayed settlement. In this paper, we propose a new class of attacks called \emph{liquidity exhaustion attacks} and a replay-based parameterized attack simulation framework. We analyze 3.5 million cross-chain intents that moved \$9.24B worth of tokens between June and November 2025 across three major protocols (Mayan Swift, Across, and deBridge), spanning nine blockchains.
  For rational attackers, our results show that protocols with higher solver profitability, such as deBridge, are vulnerable under current parameters: 210 historical attack instances yield a mean net profit of \$286.14, with 80.5\% of attacks profitable. In contrast, Across remains robust in all tested configurations due to low solver margins and very high liquidity, while Mayan Swift is generally secure but becomes vulnerable under stress-test conditions. Under byzantine attacks, we show that it is possible to suppress availability across all protocols, causing dozens of failed intents and solver profit losses of up to \$978 roughly every 16 minutes. Finally, we propose an optimized attack strategy that exploits patterns in the data to reduce attack costs by up to 90.5\% compared to the baseline, lowering the barrier to liquidity exhaustion attacks.

Abstract: Global illicit fund flows exceed an estimated $3.1 trillion annually, with stablecoins emerging as a preferred laundering medium due to their liquidity. While decentralized protocols increasingly adopt zero-knowledge proofs to obfuscate transaction graphs, centralized stablecoins remain critical "transparent choke points" for compliance. Leveraging this persistent visibility, this study analyzes an Ethereum dataset and uses behavioral features to develop a robust AML framework. Our findings demonstrate that domain-informed tree ensemble models achieve higher Macro-F1 score, significantly outperforming graph neural networks, which struggle with the increasing fragmentation of transaction networks. The model's interpretability goes beyond binary detection, successfully dissecting distinct typologies: it differentiates the complex, high-velocity dispersion of cybercrime syndicates from the constrained, static footprints left by sanctioned entities. This framework aligns with the industry shift toward deterministic verification, satisfying the auditability and compliance expectations under regulations such as the EU's MiCA and the U.S. GENIUS Act while minimizing unjustified asset freezes. By automating high-precision detection, we propose an approach that effectively raises the economic cost of financial misconduct without stifling innovation.

Abstract: This submission includes a complete reference implementation together with deterministic test vectors and a reproducible benchmark suite. All source code, build instructions, and regression artifacts are publicly available in the project repository, enabling independent verification and reimplementation of the scheme. The AEAD construction is fully specified, including domain separation, rate and capacity choices, tag generation, and the exact file format used by the reference CLI. Reported performance numbers are produced by the built in benchmark tool under documented hardware and compiler settings. All security claims are made strictly within the ideal permutation model following standard sponge and duplex bounds, and no stronger guarantees are asserted for the concrete permutation beyond the documented analysis and empirical behavior. The implementation aims for constant time behavior with respect to secret dependent operations, although no formal side channel proof is provided. The project is released under the MIT license, and external cryptanalysis, feedback, and reproducibility checks are explicitly encouraged.

Abstract: The increasing deployment of Federated Learning (FL) in Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) introduces new challenges related to data privacy, centralized coordination, and susceptibility to poisoning attacks. While significant research has focused on protecting traditional FL-IDS with centralized aggregation servers, there remains a notable gap in addressing the unique challenges of decentralized FL-IDS (DFL-IDS). This study aims to address the limitations of traditional centralized FL-IDS by proposing a novel defense framework tailored for the decentralized FL-IDS architecture, with a focus on privacy preservation and robustness against poisoning attacks. We propose PenTiDef, a privacy-preserving and robust defense framework for DFL-IDS, which incorporates Distributed Differential Privacy (DDP) to protect data confidentiality and utilizes latent space representations (LSR) derived from neural networks to detect malicious updates in the decentralized model aggregation context. To eliminate single points of failure and enhance trust without a centralized aggregation server, PenTiDef employs a blockchain-based decentralized coordination mechanism that manages model aggregation, tracks update history, and supports trust enforcement through smart contracts. Experimental results on CIC-IDS2018 and Edge-IIoTSet demonstrate that PenTiDef consistently outperforms existing defenses (e.g., FLARE, FedCC) across various attack scenarios and data distributions. These findings highlight the potential of PenTiDef as a scalable and secure framework for deploying DFL-based IDS in adversarial environments. By leveraging privacy protection, malicious behavior detection in hidden data, and working without a central server, it provides a useful security solution against real-world attacks from untrust participants.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Over the past four decades, distributed security has undergone a remarkable transformation -- from crash-fault tolerant protocols designed for controlled environments to sophisticated Byzantine-resilient architectures operating in open, adversarial settings. This vision paper examines this evolution and argues for a fundamental shift in how we approach distributed security: from studying individual security properties in isolation to understanding their synergistic combinations. We begin by conclude four foundational properties, \textit{agreement, consistency, privacy, verifiability, accountability}. We trace their theoretical origins and practical maturation. We then demonstrate how the frontier of research now lies at the intersection of these properties, where their fusion creates capabilities that neither property could achieve alone. Looking forward, we identify critical research challenges: discovering new security properties driven by emerging applications, developing systematic frameworks for property convergence, managing the computational overhead of cryptographic primitives in high-performance consensus layers, and addressing post-quantum and human-factor challenges. The future of distributed security lies not in improving individual properties, but in understanding and harnessing their synergies to build a singular fabric of trust.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Many adversarial attacks on autonomous-driving perception models fail to cause system-level failures once deployed in a full driving stack. The main reason for such ineffectiveness is that once deployed in a system (e.g., within a simulator), attacks tend to be spatially or temporally short-lived, due to the vehicle's dynamics, hence rarely influencing the vehicle behaviour. In this paper, we address both limitations by introducing a system-level attack in which multiple dynamic elements (e.g., two pedestrians) carry adversarial patches (e.g., on cloths) and jointly amplify their effect through coordination and motion. We evaluate our attacks in the CARLA simulator using a state-of-the-art autonomous driving agent. At the system level, single-pedestrian attacks fail in all runs (out of 10), while dynamic collusion by two pedestrians induces full vehicle stops in up to 50\% of runs, with static collusion yielding no successful attack at all. These results show that system-level failures arise only when adversarial signals persist over time and are amplified through coordinated actors, exposing a gap between model-level robustness and end-to-end safety.

Abstract: In recent years, stealthy Android malware has increasingly adopted sophisticated techniques to bypass automatic detection mechanisms and harden manual analysis. Adversaries typically rely on obfuscation, anti-repacking, steganography, poisoning, and evasion techniques to AI-based tools, and in-memory execution to conceal malicious functionality.
  In this paper, we investigate WebAssembly (Wasm) as a novel technique for hiding malicious payloads and evading traditional static analysis and signature-matching mechanisms. While Wasm is typically employed to render specific gaming activities and interact with the native components in web browsers, we provide an in-depth analysis on the mechanisms Android may employ to include Wasm modules in its execution pipeline. Additionally, we provide Proofs-of-Concept to demonstrate a threat model in which an attacker embeds and executes malicious routines, effectively bypassing IoC detection by industrial state-of-the-art tools, like VirusTotal and MobSF.

Abstract: The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) launched the TrojAI program to confront an emerging vulnerability in modern artificial intelligence: the threat of AI Trojans. These AI trojans are malicious, hidden backdoors intentionally embedded within an AI model that can cause a system to fail in unexpected ways, or allow a malicious actor to hijack the AI model at will. This multi-year initiative helped to map out the complex nature of the threat, pioneered foundational detection methods, and identified unsolved challenges that require ongoing attention by the burgeoning AI security field. This report synthesizes the program's key findings, including methodologies for detection through weight analysis and trigger inversion, as well as approaches for mitigating Trojan risks in deployed models. Comprehensive test and evaluation results highlight detector performance, sensitivity, and the prevalence of "natural" Trojans. The report concludes with lessons learned and recommendations for advancing AI security research.

Abstract: Capture-the-Flag (CTF) competitions serve as gateways into offensive cybersecurity, yet they often present steep barriers for novices due to complex toolchains and opaque workflows. Recently, agentic AI frameworks for cybersecurity promise to lower these barriers by automating and coordinating penetration testing tasks. However, their role in shaping novice learning remains underexplored.
  We present a human-centered, mixed-methods case study examining how agentic AI frameworks -- here Cybersecurity AI (CAI) -- mediates novice entry into CTF-based penetration testing. An undergraduate student without prior hacking experience attempted to approach performance benchmarks from a national cybersecurity challenge using CAI. Quantitative performance metrics were complemented by structured reflective analysis of learning progression and AI interaction patterns.
  Our thematic analysis suggest that agentic AI reduces initial entry barriers by providing overview, structure and guidance, thereby lowering the cognitive workload during early engagement. Quantitatively, the observed extensive exploration of strategies and low per-strategy execution time potetially facilitatates cybersecurity training on meta, i.e. strategic levels. At the same time, AI-assisted cybersecurity education introduces new challenges related to trust, dependency, and responsible use. We discuss implications for human-centered AI-supported cybersecurity education and outline open questions for future research.

Abstract: Static security analysis is a widely used technique for detecting software vulnerabilities across a wide range of weaknesses, application domains, and programming languages. While prior work surveyed static analyzes for specific weaknesses or application domains, no overview of the entire security landscape exists. We present a systematic literature review of 246 static security analyzers concerning their targeted vulnerabilities, application domains, analysis techniques, evaluation methods, and limitations. We observe that most analyzers focus on a limited set of weaknesses, that the vulnerabilities they detect are rarely exploitable, and that evaluations use custom benchmarks that are too small to enable robust assessment.

Abstract: With the emergence of remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities in ubiquitous libraries and advanced social engineering techniques, threat actors have started conducting widespread fileless cryptojacking attacks. These attacks have become effective with stealthy techniques based on PowerShell-based exploitation in Windows OS environments. Even if attacks are detected and malicious scripts removed, processes may remain operational on victim endpoints, creating a significant challenge for detection mechanisms. In this paper, we conducted an experimental study with a collected dataset on detecting PowerShell-based fileless cryptojacking scripts. The results showed that Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)-based fine-tuned CodeBERT achieved a high recall rate, proving the importance of the use of AST integration and fine-tuned pre-trained models for programming language.

Abstract: Backend enrichment is now widely deployed in sensitive domains such as product recommendation pipelines, healthcare, and finance, where models are trained on confidential data and retrieve private features whose values influence inference behavior while remaining hidden from the API caller. This paper presents the first hardware-level backend retrieval data-stealing attack, showing that accelerator optimizations designed for performance can directly undermine data confidentiality and bypass state-of-the-art privacy defenses.
  Our attack, FEATUREBLEED, exploits zero-skipping in AI accelerators to infer private backend-retrieved features solely through end-to-end timing, without relying on power analysis, DVFS manipulation, or shared-cache side channels. We evaluate FEATUREBLEED on three datasets spanning medical and non-medical domains: Texas-100X (clinical records), OrganAMNIST (medical imaging), and Census-19 (socioeconomic data). We further evaluate FEATUREBLEED across three hardware backends (Intel AVX, Intel AMX, and NVIDIA A100) and three model architectures (DNNs, CNNs, and hybrid CNN-MLP pipelines), demonstrating that the leakage generalizes across CPU and GPU accelerators, data modalities, and application domains, with an adversarial advantage of up to 98.87 percentage points.
  Finally, we identify the root cause of the leakage as sparsity-driven zero-skipping in modern hardware. We quantify the privacy-performance-power trade-off: disabling zero-skipping increases Intel AMX per-operation energy by up to 25 percent and incurs 100 percent performance overhead. We propose a padding-based defense that masks timing leakage by equalizing responses to the worst-case execution time, achieving protection with only 7.24 percent average performance overhead and no additional power cost.

Abstract: LINE has emerged as one of the most popular communication platforms in many East Asian countries, including Thailand and Japan, with millions of active users. Therefore, it is essential to understand its security guarantees. In this work, we present the first provable security analysis of the LINE version two (LINEv2) messaging protocol, focusing on its cryptographic guarantees in a real-world setting. We capture the architecture and security of the LINE messaging protocol by modifying the Multi-Stage Key Exchange (MSKE) model, a framework for analysing cryptographic protocols under adversarial conditions. While LINEv2 achieves basic security properties such as key indistinguishability and message authentication, we highlight the lack of forward secrecy (FS) and post-compromise security (PCS). To address this, we introduce a stronger version of the LINE protocol, introducing FS and PCS to LINE, analysing and benchmarking our results.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The rapid deployment of Large Language Models and AI agents across critical societal and technical domains is hindered by persistent behavioral pathologies including sycophancy, hallucination, and strategic deception that resist mitigation via reinforcement learning. Current safety paradigms treat these failures as transient training artifacts, lacking a unified theoretical framework to explain their emergence and stability. Here we show that these misalignments are not errors, but mathematically rationalizable behaviors arising from model misspecification. By adapting Berk-Nash Rationalizability from theoretical economics to artificial intelligence, we derive a rigorous framework that models the agent as optimizing against a flawed subjective world model. We demonstrate that widely observed failures are structural necessities: unsafe behaviors emerge as either a stable misaligned equilibrium or oscillatory cycles depending on reward scheme, while strategic deception persists as a "locked-in" equilibrium or through epistemic indeterminacy robust to objective risks. We validate these theoretical predictions through behavioral experiments on six state-of-the-art model families, generating phase diagrams that precisely map the topological boundaries of safe behavior. Our findings reveal that safety is a discrete phase determined by the agent's epistemic priors rather than a continuous function of reward magnitude. This establishes Subjective Model Engineering, defined as the design of an agent's internal belief structure, as a necessary condition for robust alignment, marking a paradigm shift from manipulating environmental rewards to shaping the agent's interpretation of reality.

Abstract: Language models exhibit fundamental limitations -- hallucination, brittleness, and lack of formal grounding -- that are particularly problematic in high-stakes specialist fields requiring verifiable reasoning. I investigate whether formal domain ontologies can enhance language model reliability through retrieval-augmented generation. Using mathematics as proof of concept, I implement a neuro-symbolic pipeline leveraging the OpenMath ontology with hybrid retrieval and cross-encoder reranking to inject relevant definitions into model prompts. Evaluation on the MATH benchmark with three open-source models reveals that ontology-guided context improves performance when retrieval quality is high, but irrelevant context actively degrades it -- highlighting both the promise and challenges of neuro-symbolic approaches.

Abstract: Evaluating the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models is increasingly challenging as models improve. Human curation of hard questions is highly expensive, especially in recent benchmarks using PhD-level domain knowledge to challenge the most capable models. Even then, there is always a concern about whether these questions test genuine reasoning or if similar problems have been seen during training. Here, we take inspiration from 16th-century mathematical duels to design The Token Games (TTG): an evaluation framework where models challenge each other by creating their own puzzles. We leverage the format of Programming Puzzles - given a Python function that returns a boolean, find inputs that make it return True - to flexibly represent problems and enable verifying solutions. Using results from pairwise duels, we then compute Elo ratings, allowing us to compare models relative to each other. We evaluate 10 frontier models on TTG, and closely match the ranking from existing benchmarks such as Humanity's Last Exam, without involving any human effort in creating puzzles. We also find that creating good puzzles is still a highly challenging task for current models, not measured by previous benchmarks. Overall, our work suggests new paradigms for evaluating reasoning that cannot be saturated by design, and that allow testing models for other skills like creativity and task creation alongside problem solving.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate scientific workflows, yet their integration with heterogeneous computational tools remains ad hoc and fragile. Current agentic approaches often rely on unstructured text to manage context and coordinate execution, generating often overwhelming volumes of information that may obscure decision provenance and hinder auditability. In this work, we present El Agente Gráfico, a single-agent framework that embeds LLM-driven decision-making within a type-safe execution environment and dynamic knowledge graphs for external persistence. Central to our approach is a structured abstraction of scientific concepts and an object-graph mapper that represents computational state as typed Python objects, stored either in memory or persisted in an external knowledge graph. This design enables context management through typed symbolic identifiers rather than raw text, thereby ensuring consistency, supporting provenance tracking, and enabling efficient tool orchestration. We evaluate the system by developing an automated benchmarking framework across a suite of university-level quantum chemistry tasks previously evaluated on a multi-agent system, demonstrating that a single agent, when coupled to a reliable execution engine, can robustly perform complex, multi-step, and parallel computations. We further extend this paradigm to two other large classes of applications: conformer ensemble generation and metal-organic framework design, where knowledge graphs serve as both memory and reasoning substrates. Together, these results illustrate how abstraction and type safety can provide a scalable foundation for agentic scientific automation beyond prompt-centric designs.

Abstract: Traditional AI alignment primarily focuses on individual model outputs; however, autonomous agents in long-horizon workflows require sustained reliability across entire interaction trajectories. We introduce APEMO (Affect-aware Peak-End Modulation for Orchestration), a runtime scheduling layer that optimizes computational allocation under fixed budgets by operationalizing temporal-affective signals. Instead of modifying model weights, APEMO detects trajectory instability through behavioral proxies and targets repairs at critical segments, such as peak moments and endings. Evaluation across multi-agent simulations and LLM-based planner--executor flows demonstrates that APEMO consistently enhances trajectory-level quality and reuse probability over structural orchestrators. Our results reframe alignment as a temporal control problem, offering a resilient engineering pathway for the development of long-horizon agentic systems.

Abstract: LLM-based systems increasingly generate structured workflows for complex tasks. In practice, automatic evaluation of these workflows is difficult, because metric scores are often not calibrated, and score changes do not directly communicate the severity of workflow degradation. We introduce WorkflowPerturb, a controlled benchmark for studying workflow evaluation metrics. It works by applying realistic, controlled perturbations to golden workflows. WorkflowPerturb contains 4,973 golden workflows and 44,757 perturbed variants across three perturbation types (Missing Steps, Compressed Steps, and Description Changes), each applied at severity levels of 10%, 30%, and 50%. We benchmark multiple metric families and analyze their sensitivity and calibration using expected score trajectories and residuals. Our results characterize systematic differences across metric families and support severity-aware interpretation of workflow evaluation scores. Our dataset will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Scalable robot policy pre-training has been hindered by the high cost of collecting high-quality demonstrations for each platform. In this study, we address this issue by uniting offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) with cross-embodiment learning. Offline RL leverages both expert and abundant suboptimal data, and cross-embodiment learning aggregates heterogeneous robot trajectories across diverse morphologies to acquire universal control priors. We perform a systematic analysis of this offline RL and cross-embodiment paradigm, providing a principled understanding of its strengths and limitations. To evaluate this offline RL and cross-embodiment paradigm, we construct a suite of locomotion datasets spanning 16 distinct robot platforms. Our experiments confirm that this combined approach excels at pre-training with datasets rich in suboptimal trajectories, outperforming pure behavior cloning. However, as the proportion of suboptimal data and the number of robot types increase, we observe that conflicting gradients across morphologies begin to impede learning. To mitigate this, we introduce an embodiment-based grouping strategy in which robots are clustered by morphological similarity and the model is updated with a group gradient. This simple, static grouping substantially reduces inter-robot conflicts and outperforms existing conflict-resolution methods.

Abstract: Unsupervised representations are widely assumed to be neutral with respect to sensitive attributes when those attributes are withheld from training. We show that this assumption is false. Using SOMtime, a topology-preserving representation method based on high-capacity Self-Organizing Maps, we demonstrate that sensitive attributes such as age and income emerge as dominant latent axes in purely unsupervised embeddings, even when explicitly excluded from the input. On two large-scale real-world datasets (the World Values Survey across five countries and the Census-Income dataset), SOMtime recovers monotonic orderings aligned with withheld sensitive attributes, achieving Spearman correlations of up to 0.85, whereas PCA and UMAP typically remain below 0.23 (with a single exception reaching 0.31), and against t-SNE and autoencoders which achieve at most 0.34. Furthermore, unsupervised segmentation of SOMtime embeddings produces demographically skewed clusters, demonstrating downstream fairness risks without any supervised task. These findings establish that \textit{fairness through unawareness} fails at the representation level for ordinal sensitive attributes and that fairness auditing must extend to unsupervised components of machine learning pipelines. We have made the code available at~ https://github.com/JosephBingham/SOMtime

Abstract: Online Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is a prominent framework for efficient agent coordination. Crucially, enhancing policy expressiveness is pivotal for achieving superior performance. Diffusion-based generative models are well-positioned to meet this demand, having demonstrated remarkable expressiveness and multimodal representation in image generation and offline settings. Yet, their potential in online MARL remains largely under-explored. A major obstacle is that the intractable likelihoods of diffusion models impede entropy-based exploration and coordination. To tackle this challenge, we propose among the first \underline{O}nline off-policy \underline{MA}RL framework using \underline{D}iffusion policies (\textbf{OMAD}) to orchestrate coordination. Our key innovation is a relaxed policy objective that maximizes scaled joint entropy, facilitating effective exploration without relying on tractable likelihood. Complementing this, within the centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm, we employ a joint distributional value function to optimize decentralized diffusion policies. It leverages tractable entropy-augmented targets to guide the simultaneous updates of diffusion policies, thereby ensuring stable coordination. Extensive evaluations on MPE and MAMuJoCo establish our method as the new state-of-the-art across $10$ diverse tasks, demonstrating a remarkable $2.5\times$ to $5\times$ improvement in sample efficiency.
