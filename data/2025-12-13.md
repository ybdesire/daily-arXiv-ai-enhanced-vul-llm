### [1] [LLMs Can Assist with Proposal Selection at Large User Facilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10895)
*Lijie Ding,Janell Thomson,Jon Taylor,Changwoo Do*

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 传统提案选择过程中的人工评分存在提案间相关性弱、评审者偏见和不一致性的问题，而基于成对偏好的方法虽然逻辑上更优，但对人工评审者工作量过大不实用

Method: 利用橡树岭国家实验室三个束线的精心整理的提案和发表记录，使用LLMs进行提案排名，并与人工排名进行相关性分析

Result: LLM排名与人工排名有强相关性(Spearman ρ约0.2-0.8，去除10%异常值后提升至≥0.5)，在识别高发表潜力提案方面表现不逊于人工评审，成本降低两个数量级

Conclusion: LLMs为提案选择提供了可扩展、一致且成本效益高的替代方案，不仅能进行排名，还能进行如通过嵌入模型量化评估提案相似性等高级分析

Abstract: We explore how large language models (LLMs) can enhance the proposal selection process at large user facilities, offering a scalable, consistent, and cost-effective alternative to traditional human review. Proposal selection depends on assessing the relative strength among submitted proposals; however, traditional human scoring often suffers from weak inter-proposal correlations and is subject to reviewer bias and inconsistency. A pairwise preference-based approach is logically superior, providing a more rigorous and internally consistent basis for ranking, but its quadratic workload makes it impractical for human reviewers. We address this limitation using LLMs. Leveraging the uniquely well-curated proposals and publication records from three beamlines at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), we show that the LLM rankings correlate strongly with the human rankings (Spearman $ρ\simeq 0.2-0.8$, improving to $\geq 0.5$ after 10\% outlier removal). Moreover, LLM performance is no worse than that of human reviewers in identifying proposals with high publication potential, while costing over two orders of magnitude less. Beyond ranking, LLMs enable advanced analyses that are challenging for humans, such as quantitative assessment of proposal similarity via embedding models, which provides information crucial for review committees.

Abstract: Circuit discovery aims to identify minimal subnetworks that are responsible for specific behaviors in large language models (LLMs). Existing approaches primarily rely on iterative edge pruning, which is computationally expensive and limited to coarse-grained units such as attention heads or MLP blocks, overlooking finer structures like individual neurons. We propose a node-level pruning framework for circuit discovery that addresses both scalability and granularity limitations. Our method introduces learnable masks across multiple levels of granularity, from entire blocks to individual neurons, within a unified optimization objective. Granularity-specific sparsity penalties guide the pruning process, allowing a comprehensive compression in a single fine-tuning run. Empirically, our approach identifies circuits that are smaller in nodes than those discovered by prior methods; moreover, we demonstrate that many neurons deemed important by coarse methods are actually irrelevant, while still maintaining task performance. Furthermore, our method has a significantly lower memory footprint, 5-10x, as it does not require keeping intermediate activations in the memory to work.

### [3] [On Decision-Making Agents and Higher-Order Causal Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10937)
*Matt Wilson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文在部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程（POMDPs）中的智能体与单输入过程函数（高阶量子操作的经典极限）之间建立了精确对应关系


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索人工智能决策智能体与量子物理过程函数之间的深层数学联系，为跨学科研究提供新视角

Method: 通过将智能体的策略和记忆更新组合成过程函数w，并使用link product与POMDP环境相互作用

Result: 建立了POMDP智能体与过程函数之间的对偶解释：物理学视角下过程函数作为环境，AI视角下过程函数编码智能体

Conclusion: 该对应关系可扩展到多智能体系统，将观测无关的分布式POMDPs识别为多输入过程函数的自然领域

Abstract: We establish a precise correspondence between decision-making agents in partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) and one-input process functions, the classical limit of higher-order quantum operations. In this identification an agent's policy and memory update combine into a process function w that interacts with a POMDP environment via the link product. This suggests a dual interpretation: in the physics view, the process function acts as the environment into which local operations (agent interventions) are inserted, whereas in the AI view it encodes the agent and the inserted functions represent environments. We extend this perspective to multi-agent systems by identifying observation-independent decentralized POMDPs as natural domains for multi-input process functions.
