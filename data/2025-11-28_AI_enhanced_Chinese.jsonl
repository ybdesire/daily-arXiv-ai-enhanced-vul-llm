Watermarking offers a promising solution to address these concerns by ensuring the traceability of synthetic data, but existing methods face many limitations: they are computationally expensive due to reliance on large diffusion models, struggle with mixed discrete-continuous data, or lack robustness to post-modifications. To address them, we propose TAB-DRW, an efficient and robust post-editing watermarking scheme for generative tabular data. TAB-DRW embeds watermark signals in the frequency domain: it normalizes heterogeneous features via the Yeo-Johnson transformation and standardization, applies the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), and adjusts the imaginary parts of adaptively selected entries according to precomputed pseudorandom bits. To further enhance robustness and efficiency, we introduce a novel rank-based pseudorandom bit generation method that enables row-wise retrieval without incurring storage overhead. Experiments on five benchmark tabular datasets show that TAB-DRW achieves strong detectability and robustness against common post-processing attacks, while preserving high data fidelity and fully supporting mixed-type features.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6848TAB-DRW\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u57df\u5d4c\u5165\u6c34\u5370\u4fe1\u53f7\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u6df7\u5408\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\u652f\u6301\u5dee\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5408\u6210\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u5728\u533b\u7597\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u5f15\u53d1\u6570\u636e\u6eaf\u6e90\u548c\u6ee5\u7528\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u4e0d\u652f\u6301\u6df7\u5408\u6570\u636e\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5dee\u7b49\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Yeo-Johnson\u53d8\u6362\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5f02\u6784\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u79bb\u6563\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362(DFT)\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u9884\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f2a\u968f\u673a\u4f4d\u8c03\u6574\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u6761\u76ee\u7684\u865a\u90e8\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u6392\u540d\u7684\u4f2a\u968f\u673a\u4f4d\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u5b58\u50a8\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u884c\u7ea7\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTAB-DRW\u5bf9\u5e38\u89c1\u540e\u5904\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u5e76\u5b8c\u5168\u652f\u6301\u6df7\u5408\u7c7b\u578b\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "TAB-DRW\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u6eaf\u6e90\u548c\u9632\u6ee5\u7528\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

We study these abilities directly, without code execution or other tools, using the 8-puzzle: a classic task that requires state tracking and goal-directed planning while allowing precise, step-by-step evaluation. Four models are tested under common prompting conditions (Zero-Shot, Chain-of-Thought, Algorithm-of-Thought) and with tiered corrective feedback. Feedback improves success rates for some model-prompt combinations, but many successful runs are long, computationally expensive, and indirect. We then examine the models with an external move validator that provides only valid moves. Despite this level of assistance, none of the models solve any puzzles in this setting. Qualitative analysis reveals two dominant deficits across all models: (1) brittle internal state representations, leading to frequent invalid moves, and (2) weak heuristic planning, with models entering loops or selecting actions that do not reduce the distance to the goal state. These findings indicate that, in the absence of external tools such as code interpreters, current LLMs have substantial limitations in planning and that further progress may require mechanisms for maintaining explicit state and performing structured search.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6267\u884c8\u62fc\u56fe\u89c4\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u4ee3\u7801\u6267\u884c\u6216\u5176\u4ed6\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u7eaf\u63d0\u793a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b", "method": "\u901a\u8fc78\u62fc\u56fe\u4efb\u52a1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u56db\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u3001\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u601d\u7ef4\u7b49\u6761\u4ef6", "result": "\u5373\u4f7f\u63d0\u4f9b\u5206\u5c42\u7ea0\u6b63\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4ecd\u6709\u9650\uff1b\u5728\u5916\u90e8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u8f85\u52a9\u4e0b\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u4efb\u4f55\u62fc\u56fe", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5b9e\u8d28\u6027\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u663e\u5f0f\u72b6\u6001\u7ef4\u62a4\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u641c\u7d22\u673a\u5236"}}

Existing memory-augmented agents mainly store past trajectories for reuse. However, trajectory-based memory suffers from brevity bias, gradually losing essential domain knowledge. More critically, even in truly multimodal problem-solving settings, it records only a single-modality trace of past behavior, failing to preserve how visual attention and logical reasoning jointly contributed to the solution. This is fundamentally misaligned with human cognition: semantic memory is both multimodal and integrated, preserving visual and abstract knowledge through coordinated but distinct representational streams. We thus introduce ViLoMem, a dual-stream memory framework that constructs compact, schema-based memory. It separately encodes visual distraction patterns and logical reasoning errors, enabling MLLMs to learn from their successful and failed experiences. Following a grow-and-refine principle, the system incrementally accumulates and updates multimodal semantic knowledge -- preserving stable, generalizable strategies while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Across six multimodal benchmarks, ViLoMem consistently improves pass@1 accuracy and substantially reduces repeated visual and logical errors. Ablations confirm the necessity of dual-stream memory with explicit distraction--hallucination separation, demonstrating the value of error-aware multimodal memory for lifelong and cross-domain agentic learning.
