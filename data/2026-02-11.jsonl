A security model, such as Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA), is required to overcome this challenge. ZTA treats every access request as new and assumes no implicit trust. Critical infrastructure like power plants, healthcare systems, financial systems, water supply, and military assets are especially prone to becoming targets for hackers and phishing attacks. This proposes a comprehensive framework for integrating tailored ZTA into organizations that manage sensitive operations. The paper highlights how the ZTA framework can enhance compliance, enabling continuous protection, thereby reducing attack surfaces. This paper aims to address the gap that exists in applying ZTA to endpoint management within cloud environments for critical infrastructure."}

Prior attempts to augment CHERI with temporal safety fall short in terms of scalability, memory overhead, and incomplete security guarantees due to periodical sweeps of the system's memory to individually revoke stale capabilities. We address these limitations by introducing colored capabilities that add a controlled form of indirection to CHERI's capability model. This enables provenance tracking of capabilities to their respective allocations via a hardware-managed provenance-validity table, allowing bulk retraction of dangling pointers without needing to quarantine freed memory. Colored capabilities significantly reduce the frequency of capability revocation sweeps while improving security. We realize colored capabilities in PICASSO, an extension of the CHERI-RISC-V architecture on a speculative out-of-order FPGA softcore (CHERI-Toooba). We also integrate colored-capability support into the CheriBSD OS and CHERI-enabled Clang/LLVM toolchain. Our evaluation shows effective mitigation of use-after-free and double-free bugs across all heap-based temporal memory-safety vulnerabilities in NIST Juliet test cases, with only a small performance overhead on SPEC CPU benchmarks (5% g.m.), less latency, and more consistent performance in long-running SQLite, PostgreSQL, and gRPC workloads compared to prior work."}

The final version will be available on IEEE Xplore", "summary": "Machine learning relies on randomness as a fundamental component in various steps such as data sampling, data augmentation, weight initialization, and optimization. Most machine learning frameworks use pseudorandom number generators as the source of randomness. However, variations in design choices and implementations across different frameworks, software dependencies, and hardware backends along with the lack of statistical validation can lead to previously unexplored attack vectors on machine learning systems. Such attacks on randomness sources can be extremely covert, and have a history of exploitation in real-world systems. In this work, we examine the role of randomness in the machine learning development pipeline from an adversarial point of view, and analyze the implementations of PRNGs in major machine learning frameworks. We present RNGGuard to help machine learning engineers secure their systems with low effort. RNGGuard statically analyzes a target library's source code and identifies instances of random functions and modules that use them. At runtime, RNGGuard enforces secure execution of random functions by replacing insecure function calls with RNGGuard's implementations that meet security specifications. Our evaluations show that RNGGuard presents a practical approach to close existing gaps in securing randomness sources in machine learning systems."}

While these agents offer powerful capabilities, their design exposes them to indirect prompt injection attacks embedded in untrusted web content, enabling adversaries to hijack agent behavior and violate user intent. Despite growing awareness of this threat, existing evaluations rely on fixed attack templates, manually selected injection surfaces, or narrowly scoped scenarios, limiting their ability to capture realistic, adaptive attacks encountered in practice. We present MUZZLE, an automated agentic framework for evaluating the security of web agents against indirect prompt injection attacks. MUZZLE utilizes the agent's trajectories to automatically identify high-salience injection surfaces, and adaptively generate context-aware malicious instructions that target violations of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Unlike prior approaches, MUZZLE adapts its attack strategy based on the agent's observed execution trajectory and iteratively refines attacks using feedback from failed executions. We evaluate MUZZLE across diverse web applications, user tasks, and agent configurations, demonstrating its ability to automatically and adaptively assess the security of web agents with minimal human intervention. Our results show that MUZZLE effectively discovers 37 new attacks on 4 web applications with 10 adversarial objectives that violate confidentiality, availability, or privacy properties. MUZZLE also identifies novel attack strategies, including 2 cross-application prompt injection attacks and an agent-tailored phishing scenario."}

Typically, researchers study program synthesis via large language models (LLMs) which introduce issues such as knowing what is in or out of distribution, understanding fine-tuning effects, understanding the effects of tokenization, and higher demand on compute and storage to carry out experiments. We present a system called Cadmus which includes an integer virtual machine (VM), a dataset composed of true programs of diverse tasks, and an autoregressive transformer model that is trained for under \\$200 of compute cost. The system can be used to study program completion, out-of-distribution representations, inductive reasoning, and instruction following in a setting where researchers have effective and affordable fine-grained control of the training distribution and the ability to inspect and instrument models. Smaller models working on complex reasoning tasks enable instrumentation and investigations that may be prohibitively expensive on larger models. To demonstrate that these tasks are complex enough to be of interest, we show that these Cadmus models outperform GPT-5 (by achieving 100\\% accuracy while GPT-5 has 95\\% accuracy) even on a simple task of completing correct, integer arithmetic programs in our domain-specific language (DSL) while providing transparency into the dataset's relationship to the problem. We also show that GPT-5 brings unknown priors into its reasoning process when solving the same tasks, demonstrating a confounding factor that prevents the use of large-scale LLMs for some investigations where the training set relationship to the task needs to be fully understood."}

Devices obtain globally verifiable identities without hardware changes and establish mutual TLS channels directly across administrative domains, decoupling runtime authentication from cloud reachability. We prototype Atlas on ESP32 and Raspberry Pi, integrate it with an MQTT-based IoT stack and an Atlas-aware cloud, and evaluate it in smart-home and smart-city workloads. Certificate provisioning completes in under 6s per device, mTLS adds only about 17ms of latency and modest CPU overhead, and Atlas-based applications sustain low, predictable latency compared to cloud-mediated baselines. Because many major vendors already rely on ACME-compatible CAs for their web services, Atlas is immediately deployable with minimal infrastructure changes."}

To demonstrate framework's versatility, our implementation uses three modalities - speech, text and facial imagery. However, the system is fully modular, and can be extended to support other modalities or tasks. Each modality is processed through a dedicated backbone optimized for inference efficiency: Emotion2Vec for speech, a ResNet-based model for facial expressions, and DistilRoBERTa for text. To reconcile uncertainty across modalities, we introduce a model- and task-agnostic fusion mechanism grounded in Dempster-Shafer theory and Dirichlet evidence. Operating directly on model logits, this approach captures predictive uncertainty without requiring additional training or joint distribution estimation, making it broadly applicable beyond emotion recognition. Validation on five benchmark datasets (eNTERFACE05, MEAD, MELD, RAVDESS and CREMA-D) show that our method achieves competitive accuracy while remaining computationally efficient and robust to ambiguous or missing inputs. Overall, the proposed framework emphasizes modularity, scalability, and real-world feasibility, paving the way toward uncertainty-aware multimodal systems for healthcare, human-computer interaction, and other emotion-informed applications."}

To address these limitations, we propose Brain Transformer with Adaptive Mutual-Distill and Selective Prior Fusion (BrainTAP). We introduce Adaptive Mutual Distill (AMD), which enables layer-wise information exchange between modalities through learnable distill-intact ratios, preserving modality-specific signals while capturing cross-modal synergies. We further develop Selective Prior Fusion (SPF), which integrates expert-defined anatomical priors in an adaptive way. Evaluated on the ABCD dataset for predicting attention-related disorders, BrainTAP achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness for brain disorder prediction."}

Existing systems and compiler-based approaches offer reliability but are either heavyweight or support only a limited set of optimizations. Conversely, using LLMs in a per-program optimization methodology can synthesize nontrivial optimizations, but is unreliable, expensive, and offers a low yield. In this work, we introduce a hybrid approach that works in a 3-stage manner that decouples discovery from deployment and connects them via a novel bridge. First, it discovers per-program optimizations (discovery). Second, they are converted into generalised rewrite rules (bridge). Finally, these rules are incorporated into a compiler that can automatically apply them wherever applicable, eliminating repeated reliance on LLMs (deployment). We demonstrate that RuleFlow is the new state-of-the-art (SOTA) Pandas optimization framework on PandasBench, a challenging Pandas benchmark consisting of Python notebooks. Across these notebooks, we achieve a speedup of up to 4.3x over Dias, the previous compiler-based SOTA, and 1914.9x over Modin, the previous systems-based SOTA.\n  Our code is available at https://github.com/ADAPT-uiuc/RuleFlow."}

While prior work has explored individual attack and defense techniques, the research landscape remains fragmented, spanning heterogeneous retrieval embeddings, diverse generation models, and evaluations based on non-standardized metrics and inconsistent datasets. To address this gap, we introduce the first systematic benchmark for knowledge-extraction attacks on RAG systems. Our benchmark covers a broad spectrum of attack and defense strategies, representative retrieval embedding models, and both open- and closed-source generators, all evaluated under a unified experimental framework with standardized protocols across multiple datasets. By consolidating the experimental landscape and enabling reproducible, comparable evaluation, this benchmark provides actionable insights and a practical foundation for developing privacy-preserving RAG systems in the face of emerging knowledge extraction threats.

At each step, the agent predicts its relative progress since the previous round and decides whether the newly encountered interaction should be stored, conditioning future decisions only on the retained subset. Across eight environments in the AgentGym benchmark, and using identical training trajectories, PABU achieves an 81.0% task completion rate, outperforming previous State of the art (SoTA) models with full-history belief by 23.9%. Additionally, PABU's progress-oriented action selection improves efficiency, reducing the average number of interaction steps to 9.5, corresponding to a 26.9% reduction. Ablation studies show that both explicit progress prediction and selective retention are necessary for robust belief learning and performance gains."}

Growing complexity in incentive structures has expanded the applicability of blockchain beyond purely transactional use. Existing research predominantly examines token economies within specific use cases, proposes conceptual frameworks, or studies isolated aspects such as governance, incentive design, and tokenomics. However, the literature offers limited empirically grounded, end-to-end guidance that integrates these dimensions into a coherent, step-by-step design approach informed by concrete token-economy development efforts. To address this gap, this paper presents the Token Economy Design Method (TEDM), a design-science artifact that synthesizes stepwise design propositions for token-economy design across incentives, governance, and tokenomics. TEDM is derived through an iterative qualitative synthesis of prior contributions and refined through a co-designed case. The artifact is formatively evaluated via the Currynomics case study and additional expert interviews. Currynomics is an ecosystem that maintains the Redcurry stablecoin, using real estate as the underlying asset. TEDM is positioned as reusable design guidance that facilitates the analysis of foundational requirements of tokenized ecosystems. The specificity of the proposed approach lies in the focus on the socio-technical context of the system and early stages of its design."}

Understanding these trajectories is essential for stakeholders seeking to assess project organization and health at scale. However, prior work has largely relied on static or aggregated metrics, such as project age or cumulative activity, providing limited insight into how OSS sustainability unfolds over time. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical predictive framework that models OSS projects as belonging to distinct lifecycle stages grounded in established socio-technical categorizations of OSS development. Rather than treating sustainability solely as project longevity, these lifecycle stages operationalize sustainability as a multidimensional construct integrating contribution activity, community participation, and maintenance dynamics. The framework combines engineered tabular indicators with 24-month temporal activity sequences and employs a multi-stage classification pipeline to distinguish lifecycle stages associated with different coordination and participation regimes. To support transparency, we incorporate explainable AI techniques to examine the relative contribution of feature categories to model predictions. Evaluated on a large corpus of OSS repositories, the proposed approach achieves over 94\\% overall accuracy in lifecycle stage classification. Attribution analyses consistently identify contribution activity and community-related features as dominant signals, highlighting the central role of collective participation dynamics."}

However, existing approaches often rely heavily on README files and other metadata, which are frequently missing, limiting their applicability in real-world large-scale settings. We present DRAGON, a repository classifier designed for very large and diverse software collections. It operates entirely on lightweight signals commonly stored in version control systems: file and directory names, and optionally the README when available. In repository classification at scale, DRAGON improves F1@5 from 54.8% to 60.8%, surpassing the state of the art. DRAGON remains effective even when README files are absent, with performance degrading by only 6% w.r.t. when they are present. This robustness makes it practical for real-world settings where documentation is sparse or inconsistent. Furthermore, many of the remaining classification errors are near misses, where predicted labels are semantically close to the correct topics. This property increases the practical value of the predictions in real-world software collections, where suggesting a few related topics can still guide search and discovery. As a byproduct of developing DRAGON, we also release the largest open dataset to date for repository classification, consisting of 825 thousand repositories with associated ground-truth topics, sourced from the Software Heritage archive, providing a foundation for future large-scale and language-agnostic research on software repository understanding."}

Maintaining these resources requires expert curators to search relevant papers, reconcile evidence across documents, and produce ontology-grounded annotations - a workflow that existing benchmarks, focused on isolated subtasks like named entity recognition or relation extraction, do not capture. We present FlyBench to evaluate AI agents on end-to-end agentic ontology curation from scientific literature. Given only a gene symbol, agents must search and read from a corpus of 16,898 full-text papers to produce structured annotations: Gene Ontology terms describing function, expression patterns, and historical synonyms linking decades of nomenclature. The benchmark includes 7,397 expert-curated annotations across 100 genes drawn from FlyBase, the Drosophila (fruit fly) knowledge base. We evaluate four baseline agent architectures: memorization, fixed pipeline, single-agent, and multi-agent. We find that architectural choices significantly impact performance, with multi-agent designs outperforming simpler alternatives, yet scaling backbone models yields diminishing returns. All baselines leave substantial room for improvement. Our analysis surfaces several findings to guide future development; for example, agents primarily use retrieval to confirm parametric knowledge rather than discover new information. We hope FlyBench will drive progress on retrieval-augmented scientific reasoning, a capability with broad applications across scientific domains."}

Governance is essential to ensure that large-scale compute infrastructure is not silently repurposed for training models, circumventing usage policies, or operating outside legal oversight. Because current GPUs expose limited trusted telemetry and can be modified or virtualized by adversaries, we explore whether compute-based measurements can provide actionable signals of utilization when host and device are untrusted. We introduce a measurement framework that leverages architectural characteristics of modern GPUs to generate timing- and memory-based observables that correlate with compute activity. Our design draws on four complementary primitives: (1) a probabilistic, workload-driven mechanism inspired by Proof-of-Work (PoW) to expose parallel effort, (2) sequential, latency-sensitive workloads derived via Verifiable Delay Functions (VDFs) to characterize scalar execution pressure, (3) General Matrix Multiplication (GEMM)-based tensor-core measurements that reflect dense linear-algebra throughput, and (4) a VRAM-residency test that distinguishes on-device memory locality from off-chip access through bandwidth-dependent hashing. These primitives provide statistical and behavioral indicators of GPU engagement that remain observable even without trusted firmware, enclaves, or vendor-controlled counters. We evaluate their responses to contention, architectural alignment, memory pressure, and power overhead, showing that timing shifts and residency latencies reveal meaningful utilization patterns. Our results illustrate why compute-based telemetry can complement future accountability mechanisms by exposing architectural signals relevant to post-deployment GPU governance."}

We conceptualize this period as an early-stage crystallization phase, where oversight expectations form before norms reach equilibrium.\n  Using topic modeling in a shared comparison space, a coarse-grained oversight-theme abstraction, engagement-weighted salience, and divergence tests, we show the communities are strongly separable (JSD =0.418, cosine =0.372, permutation $p=0.0005$). Across both communities, \"human control\" is an anchor term, but its operational meaning diverges: r/OpenClaw} emphasizes execution guardrails and recovery (action-risk), while r/Moltbook} emphasizes identity, legitimacy, and accountability in public interaction (meaning-risk). The resulting distinction offers a portable lens for designing and evaluating oversight mechanisms that match agent role, rather than applying one-size-fits-all control policies."}

However, there is still a lack of rigor in describing controlled experiments, hindering reproducibility and transparency. Registered Reports (RR) have been discussed in the ESE community to address these issues. A RR registers a study's hypotheses, methods, and/or analyses before execution, involving peer review and potential acceptance before data collection. This helps mitigate problematic practices such as p-hacking, publication bias, and inappropriate post hoc analysis. Objective: This paper presents initial results toward establishing an RR template for Software Engineering controlled experiments using the Open Science Framework (OSF). Method: We analyzed templates of selected OSF RR types in light of documentation guidelines for controlled experiments. Results: The observed lack of rigor motivated our investigation of OSF-based RR types. Our analysis showed that, although one of the RR types aligned with many of the documentation suggestions contained in the guidelines, none of them covered the guidelines comprehensively. The study also highlights limitations in OSF RR template customization. Conclusion: Despite progress in ESE, planning and documenting experiments still lack rigor, compromising reproducibility. Adopting OSF-based RRs is proposed. However, no currently available RR type fully satisfies the guidelines. Establishing RR-specific guidelines for SE is deemed essential."}

Current approaches, such as Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), and Discretionary Access Control (DAC), were designed for specific purposes. They cannot effectively manage the dynamic, situation-dependent workflows that modern systems require. In this research, we introduce LLMAC, a new unified approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) to combine these different access control methods into one comprehensive, understandable system. We used an extensive synthetic dataset that represents complex real-world scenarios, including policies for ownership verification, version management, workflow processes, and dynamic role separation. Using Mistral 7B, our trained LLM model achieved outstanding results with 98.5% accuracy, significantly outperforming traditional methods (RBAC: 14.5%, ABAC: 58.5%, DAC: 27.5%) while providing clear, human readable explanations for each decision. Performance testing shows that the system can be practically deployed with reasonable response times and computing resources."}

To address this gap, we introduce a framework based on topological data analysis (TDA) and persistence landscapes (PLs) to extract and quantify geometric features from data. This approach provides a theoretically grounded means of measuring diversity beyond entropy, capturing the rich geometric and structural properties of datasets. Through extensive experiments across diverse modalities, we demonstrate that our proposed PLs-based diversity metric (PLDiv) is powerful, reliable, and interpretable, directly linking data diversity to its underlying geometry and offering a foundational tool for dataset construction, augmentation, and evaluation."}

Yet some tests suffer from flakiness, where their outcomes vary non-deterministically. Flakiness erodes developer trust in test results, wastes computational resources, and undermines CI reliability. While prior research has examined test flakiness within individual projects, its broader ecosystem-wide impact remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present an empirical study of test flakiness in the OpenStack ecosystem, which focuses on (1) cross-project flakiness, where flaky tests impact multiple projects, and (2) inconsistent flakiness, where a test exhibits flakiness in some projects but remains stable in others. By analyzing 649 OpenStack projects, we identify 1,535 cross-project flaky tests and 1,105 inconsistently flaky tests. We find that cross-project flakiness affects 55% of OpenStack projects and significantly increases both review time and computational costs. Surprisingly, 70% of unit tests exhibit cross-project flakiness, challenging the assumption that unit tests are inherently insulated from issues that span modules like integration and system-level tests. Through qualitative analysis, we observe that race conditions in CI, inconsistent build configurations, and dependency mismatches are the primary causes of inconsistent flakiness. These findings underline the need for better coordination across complex ecosystems, standardized CI configurations, and improved test isolation strategies."}

Existing encoder-based attacks perturb the input image by optimizing solely on the vision encoder, rather than the entire LVLM, offering a computationally efficient alternative to end-to-end optimization. However, their transferability across different LVLM architectures in realistic black-box scenarios remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we present the first systematic study towards encoder-based adversarial transferability in LVLMs. Our contributions are threefold. First, through large-scale benchmarking over eight diverse LVLMs, we reveal that existing attacks exhibit severely limited transferability. Second, we perform in-depth analysis, disclosing two root causes that hinder the transferability: (1) inconsistent visual grounding across models, where different models focus their attention on distinct regions; (2) redundant semantic alignment within models, where a single object is dispersed across multiple overlapping token representations. Third, we propose Semantic-Guided Multimodal Attack (SGMA), a novel framework to enhance the transferability. Inspired by the discovered causes in our analysis, SGMA directs perturbations toward semantically critical regions and disrupts cross-modal grounding at both global and local levels. Extensive experiments across different victim models and tasks show that SGMA achieves higher transferability than existing attacks. These results expose critical security risks in LVLM deployment and underscore the urgent need for robust multimodal defenses."}

This heuristic discards the evidential structure of reasoning traces and is brittle under the confabulation consensus, where agents share correlated biases and converge on the same incorrect rationale. We introduce AgentAuditor, which replaces voting with a path search over a Reasoning Tree that explicitly represents agreements and divergences among agent traces. AgentAuditor resolves conflicts by comparing reasoning branches at critical divergence points, turning global adjudication into efficient, localized verification. We further propose Anti-Consensus Preference Optimization (ACPO), which trains the adjudicator on majority-failure cases and rewards evidence-based minority selections over popular errors. AgentAuditor is agnostic to MAS setting, and we find across 5 popular settings that it yields up to 5% absolute accuracy improvement over a majority vote, and up to 3% over using LLM-as-Judge."}

We introduce SWE-AGI, an open-source benchmark for evaluating end-to-end, specification-driven construction of software systems written in MoonBit. SWE-AGI tasks require LLM-based agents to implement parsers, interpreters, binary decoders, and SAT solvers strictly from authoritative standards and RFCs under a fixed API scaffold. Each task involves implementing 1,000-10,000 lines of core logic, corresponding to weeks or months of engineering effort for an experienced human developer. By leveraging the nascent MoonBit ecosystem, SWE-AGI minimizes data leakage, forcing agents to rely on long-horizon architectural reasoning rather than code retrieval. Across frontier models, gpt-5.3-codex achieves the best overall performance (solving 19/22 tasks, 86.4%), outperforming claude-opus-4.6 (15/22, 68.2%), and kimi-2.5 exhibits the strongest performance among open-source models. Performance degrades sharply with increasing task difficulty, particularly on hard, specification-intensive systems.

Traditional security paradigms - log aggregation, perimeter defense, and post-hoc forensics - cannot protect systems where AI-driven actions are irreversible, execute at machine speed, and originate from potentially compromised orchestration layers. This paper introduces Autonomous Action Runtime Management (AARM), an open specification for securing AI-driven actions at runtime. AARM defines a runtime security system that intercepts actions before execution, accumulates session context, evaluates against policy and intent alignment, enforces authorization decisions, and records tamper-evident receipts for forensic reconstruction. We formalize a threat model addressing prompt injection, confused deputy attacks, data exfiltration, and intent drift. We introduce an action classification framework distinguishing forbidden, context-dependent deny, and context-dependent allow actions. We propose four implementation architectures - protocol gateway, SDK instrumentation, kernel eBPF, and vendor integration - with distinct trust properties, and specify minimum conformance requirements for AARM-compliant systems. AARM is model-agnostic, framework-agnostic, and vendor-neutral, treating action execution as the stable security boundary. This specification aims to establish industry-wide requirements before proprietary fragmentation forecloses interoperability."}

Acting as both pre-processing and post-processing steps, our formal reasoning wrapper helps alleviating the negation attack problems and significantly improves the accuracy and efficacy of toxicity scoring.

Recent AI models show promise in vericoding, but a unified methodology for cross-paradigm evaluation is lacking. Existing benchmarks test only individual languages/tools (e.g., Dafny, Verus, and Lean) and each covers very different tasks, so the performance numbers are not directly comparable. We address this gap with AlgoVeri, a benchmark that evaluates vericoding of $77$ classical algorithms in Dafny, Verus, and Lean. By enforcing identical functional contracts, AlgoVeri reveals critical capability gaps in verification systems. While frontier models achieve tractable success in Dafny ($40.3$% for Gemini-3 Flash), where high-level abstractions and SMT automation simplify the workflow, performance collapses under the systems-level memory constraints of Verus ($24.7$%) and the explicit proof construction required by Lean (7.8%). Beyond aggregate metrics, we uncover a sharp divergence in test-time compute dynamics: Gemini-3 effectively utilizes iterative repair to boost performance (e.g., tripling pass rates in Dafny), whereas GPT-OSS saturates early. Finally, our error analysis shows that language design affects the refinement trajectory: while Dafny allows models to focus on logical correctness, Verus and Lean trap models in persistent syntactic and semantic barriers.

Our contribution lies in developing a fingerprinting system around this concept and conducting extensive validation of its effectiveness for IP protection. We demonstrate that these behavioral fingerprints are highly robust against common modifications, including finetunes, merges, and quantization. Our experiments show that the fingerprint is unique to each model family, with low cosine similarity between independently trained models. In a large-scale identification task across 76 offspring models, our method achieves 100\\% accuracy in identifying the correct base model family. Furthermore, we analyze the fingerprint's behavior under alignment-breaking attacks, finding that while performance degrades significantly, detectable traces remain.

Through these links, developers can trace the discussions in contributions and uncover design rationales, constraints, and security concerns. Previous studies have mainly examined accepted contributions, while those declined after discussion have been overlooked. The discussions behind declined contributions contain valuable design rationales and implicit knowledge about software decision-making, as the reasons behind the decline often reveal the criteria used to judge what should or should not be implemented. In this study, we present the first attempt to establish traceability links between declined contributions and related source code. We propose an initial linking approach and conduct an empirical analysis of the generated links to discuss factors affecting link generation. As our dataset, we use proposals from the official Go repository, which are GitHub issues used to propose new features or language changes. To link declined proposals to source code, we designed an LLM-driven pipeline. Our results showed that the pipeline selected the correct granularity for each declined proposal with an accuracy of 0.836, and generated correct links at that granularity with a mean precision of 0.643. To clarify the challenges of linking declined proposals, we performed a failure analysis. In the declined proposals where the pipeline failed to generate links, the discussions were often redundant and lacked concrete information (e.g., how the feature should be implemented)."}

This interest arises from its central role in developing vulnerability detection systems, copyright infringement analysis, and malware phylogeny tools. Nearly all binary function similarity systems embed assembly functions into real-valued vectors, where similar functions map to points that lie close to each other in the metric space. These embeddings enable function search: a query function is embedded and compared against a database of candidate embeddings to retrieve the most similar matches.\n  Despite their effectiveness, such systems rely on bi-encoder architectures that embed functions independently, limiting their ability to capture cross-function relationships and similarities. To address this limitation, we introduce ReSIM, a novel and enhanced function search system that complements embedding-based search with a neural re-ranker. Unlike traditional embedding models, our reranking module jointly processes query-candidate pairs to compute ranking scores based on their mutual representation, allowing for more accurate similarity assessment. By re-ranking the top results from embedding-based retrieval, ReSIM leverages fine-grained relation information that bi-encoders cannot capture.\n  We evaluate ReSIM across seven embedding models on two benchmark datasets, demonstrating consistent improvements in search effectiveness, with average gains of 21.7% in terms of nDCG and 27.8% in terms of Recall."}

This worst-case assumption is likely to overestimate the privacy threat faced by an individual in practice. In contrast, Statistical Privacy (SP), as well as related notions such as noiseless privacy or limited background knowledge privacy, describe a setting in which the adversary knows the distribution of the database entries, but not their exact realizations. In this case, privacy analysis must account for the interaction between uncertainty induced by the entropy of the underlying distributions and privacy mechanisms that distort query answers, which can be highly non-trivial.\n  This paper investigates this problem for multiple queries (composition). A privacy mechanism is proposed that is based on subsampling and randomly partitioning the database to bound the dependency among queries. This way for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, upper privacy bounds against limited adversaries are obtained without any further restriction on the database.\n  These bounds show that in realistic application scenarios taking the entropy of distributions into account yields improvements of privacy and precision guarantees. We illustrate examples where for fixed privacy parameters and utility loss SP allows significantly more queries than DP."}

However, these Long CoTs are often excessively lengthy and contain redundant reasoning steps, which can hinder inference efficiency. Compressing these long CoTs is a natural solution, yet existing approaches face two major challenges: (1) they may compromise the integrity of visual-textual reasoning by removing essential alignment cues, and (2) the compression process lacks explainability, making it difficult to discern which information is critical. To address these problems, we propose XMCC, an eXplainable Multimodal CoT Compressor that formulates compression as a sequential decision-making process optimized via reinforcement learning. XMCC can effectively shorten reasoning trajectories while preserving key reasoning steps and answer correctness, and simultaneously generates natural-language explanations for its compression decisions. Extensive experiments on representative multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that XMCC not only reduces reasoning length but also provides explainable explanations, validating its effectiveness."}

While existing research demonstrates that jailbreak attacks succeed, it does not explain \\textit{where} defenses fail or \\textit{why}.\n  To address this gap, we propose that LLM safety operates as a sequential pipeline with distinct checkpoints. We introduce the \\textbf{Four-Checkpoint Framework}, which organizes safety mechanisms along two dimensions: processing stage (input vs.\\ output) and detection level (literal vs.\\ intent). This creates four checkpoints, CP1 through CP4, each representing a defensive layer that can be independently evaluated. We design 13 evasion techniques, each targeting a specific checkpoint, enabling controlled testing of individual defensive layers.\n  Using this framework, we evaluate GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro across 3,312 single-turn, black-box test cases. We employ an LLM-as-judge approach for response classification and introduce Weighted Attack Success Rate (WASR), a severity-adjusted metric that captures partial information leakage overlooked by binary evaluation.\n  Our evaluation reveals clear patterns. Traditional Binary ASR reports 22.6\\% attack success. However, WASR reveals 52.7\\%, a 2.3$\\times$ higher vulnerability. Output-stage defenses (CP3, CP4) prove weakest at 72--79\\% WASR, while input-literal defenses (CP1) are strongest at 13\\% WASR.

Evaluating them requires approximating a large number of conditional expectations, either via Monte Carlo integration or regression. Until recently it has not been possible to fully exploit deep learning for the regression approach, because retraining for each conditional expectation takes too long. Tabular foundation models such as TabPFN overcome this computational hurdle by leveraging in-context learning, so each conditional expectation can be approximated without any re-training. In this paper, we compute Shapley values with multiple variants of TabPFN and compare their performance with state-of-the-art methods on both simulated and real datasets. In most cases, TabPFN yields the best performance; where it does not, it is only marginally worse than the best method, at a fraction of the runtime. We discuss further improvements and how tabular foundation models can be better adapted specifically for conditional Shapley value estimation."}

However, existing TPM-based multi-signature constructions suffer from a fundamental limitation, they require interactive protocols where all participants must coordinate during the commitment phase, before any signature can be computed. This interactive requirement creates several critical problems, such as synchronization bottlenecks, quadratic communication complexity, and aborted protocols as a result of participant failure. These limitations become particularly heightened for applications that require cross-device cryptographic operations. This paper presents PiTPM, an Aggregator Framework built upon Schnorr's digital signature. Our protocol eliminates the interactive requirement using a hybrid trust architecture. The proposed framework uses pre-shared randomness seeds stored securely in an Aggregator, enabling deterministic computation of global commitments without inter-participant communication. The resulting signatures of the proposed framework are of constant size regardless of signer count. Our experimental results show a possible paradigm shift in TPM-based cryptographic system design, demonstrating that hybrid trust architectures can achieve significant performance improvements while maintaining rigorous security guarantees. We provide a comprehensive formal security analysis proving EU-CMA security under the discrete logarithm assumption in the random oracle model."}

However, the widespread reliance on the response-level Bradley-Terry (BT) model may limit its full potential, as the reference and learnable models are assumed to be autoregressive only after deriving the objective function. Motivated by this limitation, we revisit the theoretical foundations of DPO and propose a novel formulation that explicitly introduces the autoregressive assumption prior to applying the BT model. By reformulating and extending DPO, we derive a novel variant, termed Autoregressive DPO (ADPO), that explicitly integrates autoregressive modeling into the preference optimization framework. Without violating the theoretical foundations, the derived loss takes an elegant form: it shifts the summation operation in the DPO objective outside the log-sigmoid function. Furthermore, through theoretical analysis of ADPO, we show that there exist two length measures to be considered when designing DPO-based algorithms: the token length $μ$ and the feedback length $μ$'. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explicitly distinguish these two measures and analyze their implications for preference optimization in LLMs."}

Using this dataset, the Mistral Codestral model was evaluated with CodeBLEU and keyword-based metrics to measure lexical and semantic similarity as well as migration correctness. Results show that the evaluated model (Mistral Codestral) can handle trivial one-to-one API substitutions with moderate success, achieving identical migrations in 11.11% of the cases, but it struggles with more complex migrations such as CORBA or JAX-WS.

Recent work has explored augmenting SAST with Large Language Models (LLMs), but these approaches typically use LLMs to triage existing tool outputs rather than to reason about vulnerability semantics directly. We introduce QRS (Query, Review, Sanitize), a neuro-symbolic framework that inverts this paradigm. Rather than filtering results from static rules, QRS employs three autonomous agents that generate CodeQL queries from a structured schema definition and few-shot examples, then validate findings through semantic reasoning and automated exploit synthesis. This architecture enables QRS to discover vulnerability classes beyond predefined patterns while substantially reducing false positives. We evaluate QRS on full Python packages rather than isolated snippets. In 20 historical CVEs in popular PyPI libraries, QRS achieves 90.6% detection accuracy. Applied to the 100 most-downloaded PyPI packages, QRS identified 39 medium-to-high-severity vulnerabilities, 5 of which were assigned new CVEs, 5 received documentation updates, while the remaining 29 were independently discovered by concurrent researchers, validating both the severity and discoverability of these findings. QRS accomplishes this with low time overhead and manageable token costs, demonstrating that LLM-driven query synthesis and code review can complement manually curated rule sets and uncover vulnerability patterns that evade existing industry tools."}

An additional difficulty stems from the relative proximity of several targets, the latter being perceived as a single target in the worst case, or influencing each other's detection thresholds. The negative impact of targets proximity notably depends on the range resolution defined by the radar parameters and the adaptive threshold adopted. This paper addresses the matter of targets detection in radar range profiles containing multiple targets with varying proximity and distorted echoes. Inspired by recent contributions in the radar and signal processing literature, this work proposes partially complex-valued neural networks as an adaptive range profile processing. Simulated datasets are generated and experiments are conducted to compare a common pulse compression approach with a simple neural network partially defined by complex-valued parameters. Whereas the pulse compression processes one pulse length at a time, the neural network put forward is a generative architecture going through the entire received signal in one go to generate a complete detection profile."}

In this work, inspired by Equivalence Modulo Inputs (EMI), we propose Quantum EMI (QEMI), a new testing approach for QSSes. Our key contributions include: (1) a random quantum program generator that produces code with dead code based on quantum control-flow structures, and (2) an adaptation of the EMI technique from classical compiler testing to generate variants by removing dead code. By comparing the behavior of these variants, we can detect potential bugs in QSS implementations. We applied QEMI to Qiskit, Q#, and Cirq, and successfully identified 11 crash bugs and 1 behavioral inconsistency. QEMI expands the limited set of testing techniques available for quantum software stacks by going beyond structural transformations and incorporating semantics-preserving ones into quantum program analysis."}

In the latter, numerical attributes are represented with predicates and this allows declaring default values, leaving the attribute undefined, making non-deterministic assignments with choice rules or using aggregated values.

In practice, code and its environment are intricately intertwined. Relying solely on static analysis of the environment leads to an inadequate understanding of the target setting, prolongs feedback cycles, and consequently causes significant rework and project delays, thereby reducing overall efficiency. We contend that successful software evolution demands a holistic perspective that integrates both code and environment migration.

The approach is enabled by two key contributions: First, we frame the reproduction problem as a code generation task where the goal is to generate a reproduction script that, when executed, reproduces the results reported in a paper. Unlike prior work on automatically reproducing research results in other domains, this formulation allows for running the script independently of the agent and for assessing the reproduction process at a fine-grained level. Second, we design automated judging mechanism that guides the agent toward the expected results without revealing them and that prevent trivial solutions, such as simply copying checked-in results. To evaluate Artisan, we introduce Artisan-Bench, the first benchmark assessing the ability to generate reproduction scripts and the first benchmark for automated artifact evaluation in software engineering. Artisan-Bench comprises 60 tasks derived from 23 software engineering papers, covering different research areas and programming languages. We validate all tasks in Artisan-Bench for reproducibility to ensure that the tasks are feasible.

Analyzing data collected through an anonymous survey of CMMC-certified assessors and lead assessors, this exploratory study investigates whether inconsistencies in evidence sampling practices exist within the CMMC assessment ecosystem and evaluates the need for a risk-informed standardized sampling methodology. Across 17 usable survey responses, results indicate that evidence sampling practices are predominantly driven by assessor judgment, perceived risk, and environmental complexity rather than formalized standards, with formal statistical sampling models rarely referenced. Participants frequently reported inconsistencies across assessments and expressed broad support for the development of standardized guidance, while generally opposing rigid percentage-based requirements. The findings support the conclusion that the absence of a uniform evidence sampling framework introduces variability that may affect assessment reliability and confidence in certification outcomes.

However, due to the autoregressive, step-by-step generation paradigm, existing CoT methods suffer from two fundamental limitations. First, the reasoning process is highly sensitive to early decisions: once an initial error is introduced, it tends to propagate and amplify through subsequent steps, while the lack of a global coordination and revision mechanism makes such errors difficult to correct, ultimately leading to distorted reasoning chains. Second, current CoT approaches lack structured analysis techniques for filtering redundant reasoning and extracting key reasoning features, resulting in unstable reasoning processes and limited interpretability. To address these issues, we propose GHS-TDA. GHS-TDA first constructs a semantically enriched global hypothesis graph to aggregate, align, and coordinate multiple candidate reasoning paths, thereby providing alternative global correction routes when local reasoning fails. It then applies topological data analysis based on persistent homology to capture stable multi-scale structures, remove redundancy and inconsistencies, and extract a more reliable reasoning skeleton. By jointly leveraging reasoning diversity and topological stability, GHS-TDA achieves self-adaptive convergence, produces high-confidence and interpretable reasoning paths, and consistently outperforms strong baselines in terms of both accuracy and robustness across multiple reasoning benchmarks."}

A primary bottleneck is the conversion of PQC reference codes from C to high-level synthesis (HLS) specifications, which requires extensive manual refactoring [1]-[3]. Another bottleneck is the scalability of synthesis for complex PQC primitives, including number theoretic transform (NTT) accelerators and wide memory interfaces. While large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable results for coding in general-purpose languages like Python, coding for hardware design is more challenging; feedback-driven and agentic integration are key principles of successful state-of-the-art approaches. Here, we propose LLM4PQC, an LLM-based agentic framework that refactors high-level PQC specifications and reference C codes into HLS-ready and synthesizable C code. Our framework generates and verifies the resulting RTL code. For correctness, we leverage a hierarchy of checks, covering fast C compilation and simulation as well as RTL simulation. Case studies on NIST PQC reference designs demonstrate a reduction in manual effort and accelerated design-space exploration compared to traditional flows. Overall, LLM4PQC provides a powerful and efficient pathway for synthesizing complex hardware accelerators."}

The pattern is then encoded in a SMT formula whose models correspond to valid plans. If the suggestion by the pattern is inaccurate and no valid plan can be found, the pattern is extended until it contains the causal order of actions in a valid plan, making the approach complete. In this paper, we extend the SPP approach to the temporal planning with Intermediate Conditions and Effects (ICEs) fragment, where $(i)$ actions are durative (and thus can overlap over time) and have conditions/effects which can be checked/applied at any time during an action's execution, and $(ii)$ one can specify plan's conditions/effects that must be checked/applied at specific times during the plan execution. Experimental results show that our SPP planner Patty $(i)$ outperforms all other planners in the literature in the majority of temporal domains without ICEs, $(ii)$ obtains comparable results with the SoTA search planner for ICS in literature domains with ICEs, and $(iii)$ outperforms the same planner in a novel domain based on a real-world application."}

The problem is not inadequate alignment or insufficient guardrails, it is architectural: autoregressive language models process all tokens uniformly, making deterministic command--data separation unattainable through training alone. We argue that deterministic, architectural enforcement, not probabilistic learned behavior, is a necessary condition for trustworthy AI-assisted science. We introduce the Trinity Defense Architecture, which enforces security through three mechanisms: action governance via a finite action calculus with reference-monitor enforcement, information-flow control via mandatory access labels preventing cross-scope leakage, and privilege separation isolating perception from execution. We show that without unforgeable provenance and deterministic mediation, the ``Lethal Trifecta'' (untrusted inputs, privileged data access, external action capability) turns authorization security into an exploit-discovery problem: training-based defenses may reduce empirical attack rates but cannot provide deterministic guarantees. The ML community must recognize that alignment is insufficient for authorization security, and that architectural mediation is required before agentic AI can be safely deployed in consequential scientific domains."}

Inferring Willingness to Pay from Subjective Choices", "comment": null, "summary": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in applications such as travel assistance and purchasing support, they are often required to make subjective choices on behalf of users in settings where no objectively correct answer exists. We study LLM decision-making in a travel-assistant context by presenting models with choice dilemmas and analyzing their responses using multinomial logit models to derive implied willingness to pay (WTP) estimates. These WTP values are subsequently compared to human benchmark values from the economics literature. In addition to a baseline setting, we examine how model behavior changes under more realistic conditions, including the provision of information about users' past choices and persona-based prompting. Our results show that while meaningful WTP values can be derived for larger LLMs, they also display systematic deviations at the attribute level. Additionally, they tend to overestimate human WTP overall, particularly when expensive options or business-oriented personas are introduced. Conditioning models on prior preferences for cheaper options yields valuations that are closer to human benchmarks. Overall, our findings highlight both the potential and the limitations of using LLMs for subjective decision support and underscore the importance of careful model selection, prompt design, and user representation when deploying such systems in practice."}

Current approaches mainly redact all PII, disregarding the fact that some of them may be contextually relevant to the user's question, resulting in a degradation of response quality. Large language models (LLMs) might be able to help determine which PII are relevant, but due to their closed source nature and lack of privacy guarantees, they are unsuitable for sensitive data processing. To achieve privacy-preserving PII detection, we propose CAPID, a practical approach that fine-tunes a locally owned small language model (SLM) that filters sensitive information before it is passed to LLMs for QA. However, existing datasets do not capture the context-dependent relevance of PII needed to train such a model effectively. To fill this gap, we propose a synthetic data generation pipeline that leverages LLMs to produce a diverse, domain-rich dataset spanning multiple PII types and relevance levels. Using this dataset, we fine-tune an SLM to detect PII spans, classify their types, and estimate contextual relevance. Our experiments show that relevance-aware PII detection with a fine-tuned SLM substantially outperforms existing baselines in span, relevance and type accuracy while preserving significantly higher downstream utility under anonymization."}

To address this challenge, we introduce a hierarchical Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework for environment design. Our framework features a teacher agent that leverages student policy representations derived from discovered evaluation environments, enabling it to generate training environments based on the student's capabilities. To improve efficiency, we incorporate a generative model that augments the teacher's training dataset with synthetic data, reducing the need for teacher-student interactions. In experiments across several domains, we show that our method outperforms baseline approaches while requiring fewer teacher-student interactions in a single episode. The results suggest the applicability of our approach in settings where training opportunities are limited."}

Recent efforts leverage Large Language Model (LLM) agents to automate this task, yet existing systems exhibit low detection accuracy even with capable models, and current evaluation frameworks assess only final answer correctness without revealing why the agent's reasoning failed. This paper presents a process level failure analysis of LLM-based RCA agents. We execute the full OpenRCA benchmark across five LLM models, producing 1,675 agent runs, and classify observed failures into 12 pitfall types across intra-agent reasoning, inter-agent communication, and agent-environment interaction. Our analysis reveals that the most prevalent pitfalls, notably hallucinated data interpretation and incomplete exploration, persist across all models regardless of capability tier, indicating that these failures originate from the shared agent architecture rather than from individual model limitations. Controlled mitigation experiments further show that prompt engineering alone cannot resolve the dominant pitfalls, whereas enriching the inter-agent communication protocol reduces communication-related failures by up to 15 percentage points. The pitfall taxonomy and diagnostic methodology developed in this work provide a foundation for designing more reliable autonomous agents for cloud RCA."}

We propose Differential Reasoning Learning (DRL), a framework that improves clinical agents by learning from reasoning discrepancies. From reference reasoning rationales (e.g., physician-authored clinical rationale, clinical guidelines, or outputs from more capable models) and the agent's free-form chain-of-thought (CoT), DRL extracts reasoning graphs as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and performs a clinically weighted graph edit distance (GED)-based discrepancy analysis. An LLM-as-a-judge aligns semantically equivalent nodes and diagnoses discrepancies between graphs. These graph-level discrepancy diagnostics are converted into natural-language instructions and stored in a Differential Reasoning Knowledge Base (DR-KB). At inference, we retrieve top-$k$ instructions via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to augment the agent prompt and patch likely logic gaps. Evaluation on open medical question answering (QA) benchmarks and a Return Visit Admissions (RVA) prediction task from internal clinical data demonstrates gains over baselines, improving both final-answer accuracy and reasoning fidelity. Ablation studies confirm gains from infusing reference reasoning rationales and the top-$k$ retrieval strategy. Clinicians' review of the output provides further assurance of the approach. Together, results suggest that DRL supports more reliable clinical decision-making in complex reasoning scenarios and offers a practical mechanism for deployment under limited token budgets."}

This problem is exacerbated when a human user wishes to either guide or interact with the agent in natural language. Although the use of Language Models (LMs) is the default choice, as an AI tool, they struggle with tasks involving physics. The LM's capability for physical reasoning is learned from observational data, rather than being grounded in simulation. A common approach is to include simulation traces as context, but this suffers from poor scalability as simulation traces contain larger volumes of fine-grained numerical and semantic data. In this paper, we propose a natural language guided method to discover coarse-grained patterns (e.g., 'rigid-body collision', 'stable support', etc.) from detailed simulation logs. Specifically, we synthesize programs that operate on simulation logs and map them to a series of high level activated patterns. We show, through two physics benchmarks, that this annotated representation of the simulation log is more amenable to natural language reasoning about physical systems. We demonstrate how this method enables LMs to generate effective reward programs from goals specified in natural language, which may be used within the context of planning or supervised learning."}

When tackling a specific task, we do not rely on a single mindset; instead, we integrate multiple mindsets within the single solution process. However, existing LLM reasoning methods fall into a common trap: they apply the same fixed mindset across all steps, overlooking that different stages of solving the same problem require fundamentally different mindsets. This single-minded assumption prevents models from reaching the next level of intelligence. To address this limitation, we propose Chain of Mindset (CoM), a training-free agentic framework that enables step-level adaptive mindset orchestration. CoM decomposes reasoning into four functionally heterogeneous mindsets: Spatial, Convergent, Divergent, and Algorithmic. A Meta-Agent dynamically selects the optimal mindset based on the evolving reasoning state, while a bidirectional Context Gate filters cross-module information flow to maintain effectiveness and efficiency. Experiments across six challenging benchmarks spanning mathematics, code generation, scientific QA, and spatial reasoning demonstrate that CoM achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the strongest baseline by 4.96\\% and 4.72\\% in overall accuracy on Qwen3-VL-32B-Instruct and Gemini-2.0-Flash, while balancing reasoning efficiency.

While reinforcement learning offers a powerful framework for training agents to master complex skills, it typically relies on hand-designed reward functions. This is infeasible for open-ended skill discovery, where the set of meaningful skills is not known a priori. While recent methods have shown promising results towards automating reward function design, they remain limited to refining rewards for pre-defined tasks. To address this limitation, we introduce Continuous Open-ended Discovery and Evolution of Skills as Hierarchical Reward Programs (CODE-SHARP), a novel framework leveraging Foundation Models (FM) to open-endedly expand and refine a hierarchical skill archive, structured as a directed graph of executable reward functions in code. We show that a goal-conditioned agent trained exclusively on the rewards generated by the discovered SHARP skills learns to solve increasingly long-horizon goals in the Craftax environment. When composed by a high-level FM-based planner, the discovered skills enable a single goal-conditioned agent to solve complex, long-horizon tasks, outperforming both pretrained agents and task-specific expert policies by over $134$% on average.

Using this pipeline, we scale to 1,000 environments covering everyday scenarios, in which agents can interact with rich toolsets (35 tools per environment on average) and obtain high-quality observations. Notably, these environments are code-driven and backed by databases, providing more reliable and consistent state transitions than environments simulated by LLMs. Moreover, they enable more efficient agent interaction compared with collecting trajectories from realistic environments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this resource, we perform large-scale reinforcement learning for multi-turn tool-use agents.

In this paper, we propose a hierarchical predictive framework that models OSS projects as belonging to distinct lifecycle stages grounded in established socio-technical categorizations of OSS development. Rather than treating sustainability solely as project longevity, these lifecycle stages operationalize sustainability as a multidimensional construct integrating contribution activity, community participation, and maintenance dynamics. The framework combines engineered tabular indicators with 24-month temporal activity sequences and employs a multi-stage classification pipeline to distinguish lifecycle stages associated with different coordination and participation regimes. To support transparency, we incorporate explainable AI techniques to examine the relative contribution of feature categories to model predictions. Evaluated on a large corpus of OSS repositories, the proposed approach achieves over 94\\% overall accuracy in lifecycle stage classification.

We present DRAGON, a repository classifier designed for very large and diverse software collections. It operates entirely on lightweight signals commonly stored in version control systems: file and directory names, and optionally the README when available. In repository classification at scale, DRAGON improves F1@5 from 54.8% to 60.8%, surpassing the state of the art. DRAGON remains effective even when README files are absent, with performance degrading by only 6% w.r.t. when they are present. This robustness makes it practical for real-world settings where documentation is sparse or inconsistent. Furthermore, many of the remaining classification errors are near misses, where predicted labels are semantically close to the correct topics. This property increases the practical value of the predictions in real-world software collections, where suggesting a few related topics can still guide search and discovery. As a byproduct of developing DRAGON, we also release the largest open dataset to date for repository classification, consisting of 825 thousand repositories with associated ground-truth topics, sourced from the Software Heritage archive, providing a foundation for future large-scale and language-agnostic research on software repository understanding."}

We present MUZZLE, an automated agentic framework for evaluating the security of web agents against indirect prompt injection attacks. MUZZLE utilizes the agent's trajectories to automatically identify high-salience injection surfaces, and adaptively generate context-aware malicious instructions that target violations of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

We evaluate MUZZLE across diverse web applications, user tasks, and agent configurations, demonstrating its ability to automatically and adaptively assess the security of web agents with minimal human intervention.

Traditional security paradigms - log aggregation, perimeter defense, and post-hoc forensics - cannot protect systems where AI-driven actions are irreversible, execute at machine speed, and originate from potentially compromised orchestration layers. This paper introduces Autonomous Action Runtime Management (AARM), an open specification for securing AI-driven actions at runtime. AARM defines a runtime security system that intercepts actions before execution, accumulates session context, evaluates against policy and intent alignment, enforces authorization decisions, and records tamper-evident receipts for forensic reconstruction. We formalize a threat model addressing prompt injection, confused deputy attacks, data exfiltration, and intent drift. We introduce an action classification framework distinguishing forbidden, context-dependent deny, and context-dependent allow actions. We propose four implementation architectures - protocol gateway, SDK instrumentation, kernel eBPF, and vendor integration - with distinct trust properties, and specify minimum conformance requirements for AARM-compliant systems. AARM is model-agnostic, framework-agnostic, and vendor-neutral, treating action execution as the stable security boundary. This specification aims to establish industry-wide requirements before proprietary fragmentation forecloses interoperability."}

Sheng"], "title": "A Behavioral Fingerprint for Large Language Models: Provenance Tracking via Refusal Vectors", "comment": null, "summary": "Protecting the intellectual property of large language models (LLMs) is a critical challenge due to the proliferation of unauthorized derivative models. We introduce a novel fingerprinting framework that leverages the behavioral patterns induced by safety alignment, applying the concept of refusal vectors for LLM provenance tracking. These vectors, extracted from directional patterns in a model's internal representations when processing harmful versus harmless prompts, serve as robust behavioral fingerprints. Our contribution lies in developing a fingerprinting system around this concept and conducting extensive validation of its effectiveness for IP protection. We demonstrate that these behavioral fingerprints are highly robust against common modifications, including finetunes, merges, and quantization. Our experiments show that the fingerprint is unique to each model family, with low cosine similarity between independently trained models. In a large-scale identification task across 76 offspring models, our method achieves 100\\% accuracy in identifying the correct base model family. Furthermore, we analyze the fingerprint's behavior under alignment-breaking attacks, finding that while performance degrades significantly, detectable traces remain. Finally, we propose a theoretical framework to transform this private fingerprint into a publicly verifiable, privacy-preserving artifact using locality-sensitive hashing and zero-knowledge proofs."}

We introduce SWE-AGI, an open-source benchmark for evaluating end-to-end, specification-driven construction of software systems written in MoonBit. SWE-AGI tasks require LLM-based agents to implement parsers, interpreters, binary decoders, and SAT solvers strictly from authoritative standards and RFCs under a fixed API scaffold. Each task involves implementing 1,000-10,000 lines of core logic, corresponding to weeks or months of engineering effort for an experienced human developer. By leveraging the nascent MoonBit ecosystem, SWE-AGI minimizes data leakage, forcing agents to rely on long-horizon architectural reasoning rather than code retrieval. Across frontier models, gpt-5.3-codex achieves the best overall performance (solving 19/22 tasks, 86.4%), outperforming claude-opus-4.6 (15/22, 68.2%), and kimi-2.5 exhibits the strongest performance among open-source models. Performance degrades sharply with increasing task difficulty, particularly on hard, specification-intensive systems. Behavioral analysis further reveals that as codebases scale, code reading, rather than writing, becomes the dominant bottleneck in AI-assisted development. Overall, while specification-driven autonomous software engineering is increasingly viable, substantial challenges remain before it can reliably support production-scale development."}

Recent AI models show promise in vericoding, but a unified methodology for cross-paradigm evaluation is lacking. Existing benchmarks test only individual languages/tools (e.g., Dafny, Verus, and Lean) and each covers very different tasks, so the performance numbers are not directly comparable. We address this gap with AlgoVeri, a benchmark that evaluates vericoding of $77$ classical algorithms in Dafny, Verus, and Lean. By enforcing identical functional contracts, AlgoVeri reveals critical capability gaps in verification systems. While frontier models achieve tractable success in Dafny ($40.3$% for Gemini-3 Flash), where high-level abstractions and SMT automation simplify the workflow, performance collapses under the systems-level memory constraints of Verus ($24.7$%) and the explicit proof construction required by Lean (7.8%). Beyond aggregate metrics, we uncover a sharp divergence in test-time compute dynamics: Gemini-3 effectively utilizes iterative repair to boost performance (e.g., tripling pass rates in Dafny), whereas GPT-OSS saturates early. Finally, our error analysis shows that language design affects the refinement trajectory: while Dafny allows models to focus on logical correctness, Verus and Lean trap models in persistent syntactic and semantic barriers.

While existing research demonstrates that jailbreak attacks succeed, it does not explain \\textit{where} defenses fail or \\textit{why}.\n  To address this gap, we propose that LLM safety operates as a sequential pipeline with distinct checkpoints. We introduce the \\textbf{Four-Checkpoint Framework}, which organizes safety mechanisms along two dimensions: processing stage (input vs.\\ output) and detection level (literal vs.\\ intent). This creates four checkpoints, CP1 through CP4, each representing a defensive layer that can be independently evaluated. We design 13 evasion techniques, each targeting a specific checkpoint, enabling controlled testing of individual defensive layers.\n  Using this framework, we evaluate GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro across 3,312 single-turn, black-box test cases. We employ an LLM-as-judge approach for response classification and introduce Weighted Attack Success Rate (WASR), a severity-adjusted metric that captures partial information leakage overlooked by binary evaluation.\n  Our evaluation reveals clear patterns. Traditional Binary ASR reports 22.6\\% attack success. However, WASR reveals 52.7\\%, a 2.3$\\times$ higher vulnerability. Output-stage defenses (CP3, CP4) prove weakest at 72--79\\% WASR, while input-literal defenses (CP1) are strongest at 13\\% WASR. Claude achieves the strongest safety (42.8\\% WASR), followed by GPT-5 (55.9\\%) and Gemini (59.5\\%).\n  These findings suggest that current defenses are strongest at input-literal checkpoints but remain vulnerable to intent-level manipulation and output-stage techniques. The Four-Checkpoint Framework provides a structured approach for identifying and addressing safety vulnerabilities in deployed systems."}
