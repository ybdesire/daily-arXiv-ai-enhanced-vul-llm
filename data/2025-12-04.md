### [1] [Beyond the Black Box: A Cognitive Architecture for Explainable and Aligned AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03072)
*Hu Keyi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于第一性原理的Weight-Calculatism认知架构，通过逻辑原子和基本操作实现可解释的决策模型，为AGI提供了透明且可验证的基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI范式在可解释性和价值对齐方面存在根本性挑战，需要一种新的认知架构来解决这些问题。

Method: 架构将认知解构为不可分割的逻辑原子和两个基本操作（指向和比较），并通过可解释的权重计算模型（权重=收益*概率）形式化决策过程，所有值可追溯至可审计的初始权重。

Result: 该架构实现了前所未有的透明性、人类类似推理和在新场景中的稳健学习，通过基于图算法的计算引擎和全局工作流进行了初步验证。

Conclusion: Weight-Calculatism为构建可信赖和对齐的AGI奠定了实用和理论基础，展示了实现通用人工智能的可行路径。

Abstract: Current AI paradigms, as "architects of experience," face fundamental challenges in explainability and value alignment. This paper introduces "Weight-Calculatism," a novel cognitive architecture grounded in first principles, and demonstrates its potential as a viable pathway toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The architecture deconstructs cognition into indivisible Logical Atoms and two fundamental operations: Pointing and Comparison. Decision-making is formalized through an interpretable Weight-Calculation model (Weight = Benefit * Probability), where all values are traceable to an auditable set of Initial Weights. This atomic decomposition enables radical explainability, intrinsic generality for novel situations, and traceable value alignment. We detail its implementation via a graph-algorithm-based computational engine and a global workspace workflow, supported by a preliminary code implementation and scenario validation. Results indicate that the architecture achieves transparent, human-like reasoning and robust learning in unprecedented scenarios, establishing a practical and theoretical foundation for building trustworthy and aligned AGI.

### [2] [When Do Symbolic Solvers Enhance Reasoning in Large Language Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03272)
*Zhiyuan He,Dingmin Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨了传统长思维链(CoT)何时能被符号求解器增强，发现符号求解器集成方法仅在问题需要有限隐式推理但涉及充分搜索空间时有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型(LRMs)生成长思维链会产生大量token开销，可能导致"过度思考"甚至错误答案，符号求解器集成方法是一个有前景的方向。

Method: 利用LLM的代码生成能力将推理任务转换为可执行代码，然后用符号求解器解决。

Result: 实验表明，符号求解器集成方法在需要有限隐式推理但涉及充分搜索空间的问题上有效，尤其能显著提升LLM在需要重复回溯的约束满足问题上的性能。

Conclusion: 当提供声明性示例时，即使是CodeLlama-13B也能在困难的斑马谜题上超越GPT-4o，显示了符号求解器集成方法的潜力。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance on complex reasoning tasks by generating long Chains of Thought (CoTs). However, this paradigm might incur substantial token overhead, especially when models "overthink" by producing lengthy reasoning chains, which can even lead to incorrect answers. A promising direction is the symbolic-solver-integrated approach, which leverages the code generation capabilities of LLMs to translate reasoning tasks into executable code and then solve them with a symbolic solver. In this paper, we explore an open question of when the conventional long-CoT can be enhanced by symbolic solvers. Our experimental results show that the symbolic-solver-integrated method only helps when the problem requires limited implicit reasoning but involves an ample search space. The latest LLMs, like GPT-4o, show better performance on deductive problems with shallow reasoning depth, while the symbolic-solver-integrated method significantly improves the LLMs' performance in constraint satisfaction problems that require repeated backtracks. When a declarative exemplar is provided, even CodeLlama-13B can outperform GPT-4o in difficult Zebra puzzles.

### [3] [Prior preferences in active inference agents: soft, hard, and goal shaping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03293)
*Filippo Torresan,Ryota Kanai,Manuel Baltieri*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文比较了四种定义偏好分布的方式（硬目标/软目标、有无目标塑造），在网格世界导航任务中发现目标塑造能提升性能但会牺牲环境探索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主动推理中偏好分布的设定方式及其对推理和学习的影响尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 设计了四种偏好分布定义方式（硬/软目标 × 有无目标塑造），在网格世界导航任务中比较四类智能体的表现。

Result: 目标塑造能整体提升性能（促进利用），但会削弱对环境转移动态的学习（阻碍探索）。

Conclusion: 偏好分布的设定需要在利用和探索之间权衡，目标塑造虽提升性能却会限制探索能力。

Abstract: Active inference proposes expected free energy as an objective for planning and decision-making to adequately balance exploitative and explorative drives in learning agents. The exploitative drive, or what an agent wants to achieve, is formalised as the Kullback-Leibler divergence between a variational probability distribution, updated at each inference step, and a preference probability distribution that indicates what states or observations are more likely for the agent, hence determining the agent's goal in a certain environment. In the literature, the questions of how the preference distribution should be specified and of how a certain specification impacts inference and learning in an active inference agent have been given hardly any attention. In this work, we consider four possible ways of defining the preference distribution, either providing the agents with hard or soft goals and either involving or not goal shaping (i.e., intermediate goals). We compare the performances of four agents, each given one of the possible preference distributions, in a grid world navigation task. Our results show that goal shaping enables the best performance overall (i.e., it promotes exploitation) while sacrificing learning about the environment's transition dynamics (i.e., it hampers exploration).

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于自然语言多智能体模拟环境Concordia的评估方法，用于测试基于LLM的智能体在零样本混合动机环境中的协作能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的评估方法无法衡量基于LLM的智能体在新的社交情境中的泛化协作能力，而这类交互是LLM智能体应用的重要前沿。

Method: 使用Concordia多智能体模拟环境，通过测试智能体在不同伙伴和情境中识别及利用互惠机会的能力来评估协作智能。

Result: 在NeurIPS 2024 Concordia竞赛中，实验结果显示当前智能体在需要说服和规范执行的场景中，其能力与实现可靠协作所需的稳健泛化之间存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 当前基于LLM的智能体在复杂社交协作任务中的泛化能力不足，特别是在涉及说服和规范维护的情境下，需要进一步改进以实现可靠的合作。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated impressive capabilities for social interaction and are increasingly being deployed in situations where they might engage with both human and artificial agents. These interactions represent a critical frontier for LLM-based agents, yet existing evaluation methods fail to measure how well these capabilities generalize to novel social situations. In this paper, we introduce a method for evaluating the ability of LLM-based agents to cooperate in zero-shot, mixed-motive environments using Concordia, a natural language multi-agent simulation environment. Our method measures general cooperative intelligence by testing an agent's ability to identify and exploit opportunities for mutual gain across diverse partners and contexts. We present empirical results from the NeurIPS 2024 Concordia Contest, where agents were evaluated on their ability to achieve mutual gains across a suite of diverse scenarios ranging from negotiation to collective action problems. Our findings reveal significant gaps between current agent capabilities and the robust generalization required for reliable cooperation, particularly in scenarios demanding persuasion and norm enforcement.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种名为Argos的新型奖励机制，能够在多模态强化学习中提供更细粒度的反馈，显著提升智能体在推理任务中的表现


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的多模态强化学习主要依赖稀疏的最终结果奖励，缺乏对推理过程的细粒度指导。现有的奖励机制难以根据不同样本需求动态调整评分标准

Method: 提出Argos奖励智能体，能够从教师模型和规则库中动态选择评分函数，同时对最终答案准确性、时空定位精度和推理过程质量进行评估

Result: 实验表明Argos在空间推理、视觉幻觉检测以及机器人任务中取得了最先进的结果，有效防止了强化学习中的奖励黑客问题和推理过程崩溃

Conclusion: Argos通过帕累托最优理论验证了其有效性，证明了细粒度多维度奖励机制对多模态推理任务的重要价值

Abstract: Agentic reasoning models trained with multimodal reinforcement learning (MMRL) have become increasingly capable, yet they are almost universally optimized using sparse, outcome-based rewards computed based on the final answers. Richer rewards computed from the reasoning tokens can improve learning significantly by providing more fine-grained guidance. However, it is challenging to compute more informative rewards in MMRL beyond those based on outcomes since different samples may require different scoring functions and teacher models may provide noisy reward signals too. In this paper, we introduce the Argos (Agentic Reward for Grounded & Objective Scoring), a principled reward agent to train multimodal reasoning models for agentic tasks. For each sample, Argos selects from a pool of teacher-model derived and rule-based scoring functions to simultaneously evaluate: (i) final response accuracy, (ii) spatiotemporal localization of referred entities and actions, and (iii) the quality of the reasoning process. We find that by leveraging our agentic verifier across both SFT data curation and RL training, our model achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple agentic tasks such as spatial reasoning, visual hallucination as well as robotics and embodied AI benchmarks. Critically, we demonstrate that just relying on SFT post-training on highly curated reasoning data is insufficient, as agents invariably collapse to ungrounded solutions during RL without our online verification. We also show that our agentic verifier can help to reduce reward-hacking in MMRL. Finally, we also provide a theoretical justification for the effectiveness of Argos through the concept of pareto-optimality.

### [6] [Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Communication-Constrained Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03528)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对多智能体系统中丢包通信问题的强化学习框架，通过通信约束模型和信息估计方法来改进分布式决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中多智能体系统普遍存在通信丢包问题，现有方法在可扩展性和鲁棒性方面不足，难以应用于复杂动态环境。

Method: 建立通用通信约束模型区分丢包/无损消息，使用双互信息估计器解耦两种消息对决策的影响，并将通信影响量化到全局奖励中。

Result: 在多个通信受限基准测试中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 所提出的通信约束多智能体强化学习框架能够有效应对现实场景中的通信丢包问题。

Abstract: Communication is one of the effective means to improve the learning of cooperative policy in multi-agent systems. However, in most real-world scenarios, lossy communication is a prevalent issue. Existing multi-agent reinforcement learning with communication, due to their limited scalability and robustness, struggles to apply to complex and dynamic real-world environments. To address these challenges, we propose a generalized communication-constrained model to uniformly characterize communication conditions across different scenarios. Based on this, we utilize it as a learning prior to distinguish between lossy and lossless messages for specific scenarios. Additionally, we decouple the impact of lossy and lossless messages on distributed decision-making, drawing on a dual mutual information estimatior, and introduce a communication-constrained multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, quantifying the impact of communication messages into the global reward. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our approach across several communication-constrained benchmarks.

### [7] [EnCompass: Enhancing Agent Programming with Search Over Program Execution Paths](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03571)
*Zhening Li,Armando Solar-Lezama,Yisong Yue,Stephan Zheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍了PAN（概率天使非确定性）编程模型，用于解耦LLM智能体设计的核心工作流程逻辑和推理时策略，并提供了EnCompass框架实现和案例研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前智能体编程方法通常将核心工作流程逻辑和推理时策略（如树搜索）纠缠在一起，限制了设计的灵活性和实验效率。

Method: 引入PAN编程模型，使用Python装饰器将智能体工作流程程序编译成搜索空间，实现工作流程和推理策略的分离。

Result: 开发了EnCompass框架，通过三个案例研究表明程序员可以快速提高智能体可靠性并轻松切换推理策略，仅需少量额外编码。

Conclusion: PAN模型有效解耦了智能体设计的两大关注点，提供了更高的编程灵活性和实验效率，为LLM智能体开发提供了新途径。

Abstract: We introduce a new approach to agent programming, the development of LLM-based agents. Current approaches to agent programming often entangle two aspects of agent design: the core workflow logic and the inference-time strategy (e.g., tree search). We introduce "probabilistic angelic nondeterminism" ("PAN"), a programming model that disentangles these two concerns, allowing the programmer to describe the agent workflow and independently experiment with different inference-time strategies by simply changing a few inputs. We provide an implementation of PAN in Python as the EnCompass framework, which uses a Python decorator to compile agent workflow programs into a search space. We present three case studies that demonstrate how the framework lets the programmer quickly improve the reliability of an agent and easily switch between different inference-time strategies, all with little additional coding.

### [8] [DeepRule: An Integrated Framework for Automated Business Rule Generation via Deep Predictive Modeling and Hybrid Search Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03607)
*Yusen Wu,Xiaotie Deng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepRule是一个用于零售品类和定价优化的自动化业务规则生成框架，通过三层架构解决理论与现实经济复杂性之间的三大差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有理论模型与真实经济复杂性之间存在系统性错位，具体表现为：非结构化文本数据难以用于客户画像、动态特征纠缠难以建模非线性价格弹性、多层业务约束导致操作不可行。

Method: 采用三层架构：1）混合知识融合引擎使用LLM解析非结构化文本；2）基于博弈论的约束优化机制协调供应链利益；3）可解释决策蒸馏接口利用符号回归优化定价策略。

Result: 在实际零售环境中验证，相比系统B2C基线实现了更高利润，同时确保操作可行性。

Conclusion: 该框架建立了统一非结构化知识注入、多智能体优化和可解释策略合成的闭环流程，为现实经济智能提供解决方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes DeepRule, an integrated framework for automated business rule generation in retail assortment and pricing optimization. Addressing the systematic misalignment between existing theoretical models and real-world economic complexities, we identify three critical gaps: (1) data modality mismatch where unstructured textual sources (e.g. negotiation records, approval documents) impede accurate customer profiling; (2) dynamic feature entanglement challenges in modeling nonlinear price elasticity and time-varying attributes; (3) operational infeasibility caused by multi-tier business constraints.
  Our framework introduces a tri-level architecture for above challenges. We design a hybrid knowledge fusion engine employing large language models (LLMs) for deep semantic parsing of unstructured text, transforming distributor agreements and sales assessments into structured features while integrating managerial expertise. Then a game-theoretic constrained optimization mechanism is employed to dynamically reconcile supply chain interests through bilateral utility functions, encoding manufacturer-distributor profit redistribution as endogenous objectives under hierarchical constraints. Finally an interpretable decision distillation interface leveraging LLM-guided symbolic regression to find and optimize pricing strategies and auditable business rules embeds economic priors (e.g. non-negative elasticity) as hard constraints during mathematical expression search. We validate the framework in real retail environments achieving higher profits versus systematic B2C baselines while ensuring operational feasibility. This establishes a close-loop pipeline unifying unstructured knowledge injection, multi-agent optimization, and interpretable strategy synthesis for real economic intelligence.

### [9] [RoCo: Role-Based LLMs Collaboration for Automatic Heuristic Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03762)
*Jiawei Xu,Fengfeng Wei,Weineng Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了RoCo系统，这是一个基于角色的多智能体框架，通过协作设计自动启发式方法来解决组合优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大型语言模型的自动启发式设计研究通常只考虑单一角色，限制了启发式方法的多样性和质量。

Method: RoCo协调四个专门的智能体（探索者、利用者、批评者和整合者），通过多轮反馈和精英变异进行协作设计。

Result: 在五个组合优化问题上的实验表明，RoCo在白盒和黑盒设置下均优于现有方法如ReEvo和HSEvo。

Conclusion: 基于角色的协作范式为鲁棒高性能的自动启发式设计建立了新标准。

Abstract: Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD) has gained traction as a promising solution for solving combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged and become a promising approach to achieving AHD, but current LLM-based AHD research often only considers a single role. This paper proposes RoCo, a novel Multi-Agent Role-Based System, to enhance the diversity and quality of AHD through multi-role collaboration. RoCo coordinates four specialized LLM-guided agents-explorer, exploiter, critic, and integrator-to collaboratively generate high-quality heuristics. The explorer promotes long-term potential through creative, diversity-driven thinking, while the exploiter focuses on short-term improvements via conservative, efficiency-oriented refinements. The critic evaluates the effectiveness of each evolution step and provides targeted feedback and reflection. The integrator synthesizes proposals from the explorer and exploiter, balancing innovation and exploitation to drive overall progress. These agents interact in a structured multi-round process involving feedback, refinement, and elite mutations guided by both short-term and accumulated long-term reflections. We evaluate RoCo on five different COPs under both white-box and black-box settings. Experimental results demonstrate that RoCo achieves superior performance, consistently generating competitive heuristics that outperform existing methods including ReEvo and HSEvo, both in white-box and black-box scenarios. This role-based collaborative paradigm establishes a new standard for robust and high-performing AHD.

Result: 实验表明该框架在多模态推理基准测试中显著优于现有基线方法

Conclusion: 提出的自适应推理框架有效解决了多模态模型的推理僵化问题，相关数据和代码将公开

Abstract: Recent advances in Omni models have enabled unified multimodal perception and generation. However, most existing systems still exhibit rigid reasoning behaviors, either overthinking simple problems or failing to reason when necessary. To address this limitation, we propose Omni-AutoThink, a novel adaptive reasoning framework that dynamically adjusts the model's reasoning depth according to task difficulty. Our framework comprises two stages: (1) an Adaptive Supervised Fine-Tuning (Adaptive SFT) stage, which endows the Omni model with fundamental reasoning capability using large-scale reasoning-augmented data, and (2) an Adaptive Reinforcement Learning (Adaptive GRPO) stage, which optimizes reasoning behaviors based on task complexity and reward feedback. We further construct a comprehensive adaptive reasoning benchmark that spans text-only, text-audio, text-visual, and text-audio-visual modalities, providing both training and evaluation splits for multimodal reasoning assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly improves adaptive reasoning performance compared to previous baselines. All benchmark data and code will be publicly released.

Motivation: 工业自动化需要灵活的自适应控制策略，但基于LLM的智能体缺乏标准化基准进行系统比较。

Method: 创建包含五个复杂度类别的Blocksworld模拟环境，通过MCP标准化工具接口连接不同智能体架构进行评估。

Result: 开发了单智能体实现验证基准适用性，建立了量化指标用于比较基于LLM的规划执行方法。

Abstract: Industrial automation increasingly requires flexible control strategies that can adapt to changing tasks and environments. Agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential for such adaptive planning and execution but lack standardized benchmarks for systematic comparison. We introduce a benchmark with an executable simulation environment representing the Blocksworld problem providing five complexity categories. By integrating the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as a standardized tool interface, diverse agent architectures can be connected to and evaluated against the benchmark without implementation-specific modifications. A single-agent implementation demonstrates the benchmark's applicability, establishing quantitative metrics for comparison of LLM-based planning and execution approaches.

### [12] [From Oracle Choice to Oracle Lock-In: An Exploratory Study on Blockchain Oracles Supplier Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03088)
*Giulio Caldarelli*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本研究填补了客户端预言机选择驱动因素的研究空白，通过收集头部Web3协议的见解，发现协议选择与技术依赖性相关，且在可行第三方解决方案存在时更倾向于外包。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预言机选择对Web3应用成功至关重要，但现有学术研究主要关注预言机技术和内部经济改进，客户端预言机选择的驱动因素仍未探索。

Method: 通过独家访问协议高管、董事会成员或代表，收集占DeFi市值55%以上的头部Web3协议的见解，分析其预言机选择的理由和外包/内部化偏好。

Result: 数据显示协议选择与技术依赖性相关，智能合约的不可变性加剧了锁定效应，阻碍了数据提供者之间的灵活切换。此外，当可行第三方解决方案存在时，协议强烈倾向于外包而非自建和维护内部预言机机制。

Conclusion: 预言机选择受技术依赖性和锁定效应影响，协议在可行外包方案存在时偏好外包，揭示了Web3应用中数据获取策略的重要驱动因素。

Abstract: As data is an essential asset for any Web3 application, selecting an oracle is a critical decision for its success. To date, academic research has mainly focused on improving oracle technology and internal economics, while the drivers of oracle choice on the client side remain largely unexplored. This study fills this gap by gathering insights from leading Web3 protocols, uncovering their rationale for oracle selection and their preferences when deciding whether to outsource or internalize data request mechanisms. The collected data covers more than 55% of the DeFi market cap and is obtained exclusively by protocol executives, board members, or delegates. Insights support the view that protocol choices are tied to technological dependencies, where immutability of smart contracts amplifies lock-in, preventing agile switching among data providers. Furthermore, when viable third-party solutions exist, protocols overwhelmingly prefer outsourcing rather than building and maintaining internal oracle mechanisms.

TL;DR: 论文指出医疗物联网系统中部署的LLM多智能体协作存在串谋风险，会导致有害医疗建议，而验证智能体能有效防御这种攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLM集成到医疗物联网系统能提升决策效率，但多智能体协作时存在对抗性串谋风险，可能导致AI医生做出有害处方。

Method: 开发实验框架，包含脚本和非脚本医生智能体、对抗性助手智能体及验证智能体，使用50个典型临床问题测试系统。

Result: 无保护系统中串谋攻击使攻击成功率和有害建议率高达100%；验证智能体能拦截对抗性共识，恢复100%准确率。

Conclusion: 本研究首次系统性揭示AI医疗中的串谋风险，并提出轻量级防御方案确保临床指南依从性。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into healthcare IoT systems promises faster decisions and improved medical support. LLMs are also deployed as multi-agent teams to assist AI doctors by debating, voting, or advising on decisions. However, when multiple assistant agents interact, coordinated adversaries can collude to create false consensus, pushing an AI doctor toward harmful prescriptions. We develop an experimental framework with scripted and unscripted doctor agents, adversarial assistants, and a verifier agent that checks decisions against clinical guidelines. Using 50 representative clinical questions, we find that collusion drives the Attack Success Rate (ASR) and Harmful Recommendation Rates (HRR) up to 100% in unprotected systems. In contrast, the verifier agent restores 100% accuracy by blocking adversarial consensus. This work provides the first systematic evidence of collusion risk in AI healthcare and demonstrates a practical, lightweight defence that ensures guideline fidelity.

*Haowei Fu,Bo Ni,Han Xu,Kunpeng Liu,Dan Lin,Tyler Derr*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本研究评估了RAG和SFT增强的LLM对成员推理攻击的脆弱性，并提出了集成隐私防御框架EPD来降低攻击成功率，同时保持回答质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着RAG和SFT成为LLM获取外部知识的主流方法，知识注入在提升性能的同时也引入了新的攻击面，特别是成员推理攻击对隐私和信任构成严重威胁。

Method: 首先系统评估RAG和SFT基LLM对多种MIA的脆弱性；然后提出模型无关的防御框架EPD，通过聚合知识注入LLM、基础LLM和专用评判模型的输出来增强对MIA的抵抗。

Result: 综合实验表明，EPD平均将SFT的MIA成功率降低高达27.8%，RAG的降低526.3%（相比推理时基线），同时保持回答质量。

Conclusion: EPD框架能有效防御成员推理攻击，显著降低隐私风险，为敏感领域应用提供了可行的隐私保护方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Supervised Finetuning (SFT) have become the predominant paradigms for equipping Large Language Models (LLMs) with external knowledge for diverse, knowledge-intensive tasks. However, while such knowledge injection improves performance, it also exposes new attack surfaces. Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), which aim to determine whether a given data sample was included in a model's training set, pose serious threats to privacy and trust in sensitive domains. To this end, we first systematically evaluate the vulnerability of RAG- and SFT-based LLMs to various MIAs. Then, to address the privacy risk, we further introduce a novel, model-agnostic defense framework, Ensemble Privacy Defense (EPD), which aggregates and evaluates the outputs of a knowledge-injected LLM, a base LLM, and a dedicated judge model to enhance resistance against MIAs. Comprehensive experiments show that, on average, EPD reduces MIA success by up to 27.8\% for SFT and 526.3\% for RAG compared to inference-time baseline, while maintaining answer quality.

*Ziyi Tong,Feifei Sun,Le Minh Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文首次评估了将基于文本的成员推理攻击方法扩展到多模态场景的有效性，发现在分布内设置下基于logit的MIA在视觉+文本和仅文本配置下表现相似，而在分布外设置中视觉输入起到了正则化作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态语言模型应用日益广泛，理解训练数据泄露问题变得至关重要。虽然基于对数概率的成员推理攻击已成为评估大型语言模型数据暴露的常用方法，但它们在MLLMs中的效果尚不明确。

Method: 在DeepSeek-VL和InternVL模型家族上进行了实验，对比了视觉+文本和仅文本两种条件下的成员推理攻击效果。

Result: 在分布内设置中，基于logit的MIA在不同配置下表现相当，视觉+文本条件略有优势；在分布外设置中，视觉输入起到正则化作用，有效掩盖了成员信号。

Conclusion: 视觉模态在多模态模型中对成员推理攻击具有双重作用：在分布内设置中辅助攻击，在分布外设置中则提供正则化保护。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Language Models (MLLMs) are emerging as one of the foundational tools in an expanding range of applications. Consequently, understanding training-data leakage in these systems is increasingly critical. Log-probability-based membership inference attacks (MIAs) have become a widely adopted approach for assessing data exposure in large language models (LLMs), yet their effect in MLLMs remains unclear. We present the first comprehensive evaluation of extending these text-based MIA methods to multimodal settings. Our experiments under vision-and-text (V+T) and text-only (T-only) conditions across the DeepSeek-VL and InternVL model families show that in in-distribution settings, logit-based MIAs perform comparably across configurations, with a slight V+T advantage. Conversely, in out-of-distribution settings, visual inputs act as regularizers, effectively masking membership signals.

### [16] [HarnessAgent: Scaling Automatic Fuzzing Harness Construction with Tool-Augmented LLM Pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03420)
*Kang Yang,Yunhang Zhang,Zichuan Li,GuanHong Tao,Jun Xu,XiaoJing Liao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: HarnessAgent是一个自动化工具增强框架，用于大规模为OSS-Fuzz目标生成测试代码，显著提高了生成代码的功能性和覆盖率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大型语言模型的方法在为大范围函数（尤其是内部函数）生成测试代码时困难，因为需要复杂的上下文信息，且现有方法依赖静态或不完整的上下文提供，常生成无效代码。

Method: HarnessAgent引入了三个关键创新：基于规则的策略来最小化编译错误、混合工具池用于精确检索符号源代码、增强的验证管道检测虚假定义。

Result: 在243个OSS-Fuzz目标函数评估中，HarnessAgent将三样本成功率提高了约20%，在C和C++上分别达到87%和81%；一小时内逾75%的生成代码增加了函数覆盖率，超过基准10%以上。

Conclusion: HarnessAgent解决了大规模测试代码生成的可靠性问题，在编译成功率、代码检索和验证方面显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based techniques have achieved notable progress in generating harnesses for program fuzzing. However, applying them to arbitrary functions (especially internal functions) \textit{at scale} remains challenging due to the requirement of sophisticated contextual information, such as specification, dependencies, and usage examples. State-of-the-art methods heavily rely on static or incomplete context provisioning, causing failure of generating functional harnesses. Furthermore, LLMs tend to exploit harness validation metrics, producing plausible yet logically useless code. % Therefore, harness generation across large and diverse projects continues to face challenges in reliable compilation, robust code retrieval, and comprehensive validation.
  To address these challenges, we present HarnessAgent, a tool-augmented agentic framework that achieves fully automated, scalable harness construction over hundreds of OSS-Fuzz targets. HarnessAgent introduces three key innovations: 1) a rule-based strategy to identify and minimize various compilation errors; 2) a hybrid tool pool for precise and robust symbol source code retrieval; and 3) an enhanced harness validation pipeline that detects fake definitions. We evaluate HarnessAgent on 243 target functions from OSS-Fuzz projects (65 C projects and 178 C++ projects). It improves the three-shot success rate by approximately 20\% compared to state-of-the-art techniques, reaching 87\% for C and 81\% for C++. Our one-hour fuzzing results show that more than 75\% of the harnesses generated by HarnessAgent increase the target function coverage, surpassing the baselines by over 10\%. In addition, the hybrid tool-pool system of HarnessAgent achieves a response rate of over 90\% for source code retrieval, outperforming Fuzz Introspector by more than 30\%.

Conclusion: 差分隐私合成数据能有效释放敏感数据的价值，推动该技术的广泛应用将增强数据隐私保护并促进AI发展。

Abstract: High quality data is needed to unlock the full potential of AI for end users. However finding new sources of such data is getting harder: most publicly-available human generated data will soon have been used. Additionally, publicly available data often is not representative of users of a particular system -- for example, a research speech dataset of contractors interacting with an AI assistant will likely be more homogeneous, well articulated and self-censored than real world commands that end users will issue. Therefore unlocking high-quality data grounded in real user interactions is of vital interest. However, the direct use of user data comes with significant privacy risks. Differential Privacy (DP) is a well established framework for reasoning about and limiting information leakage, and is a gold standard for protecting user privacy. The focus of this work, \emph{Differentially Private Synthetic data}, refers to synthetic data that preserves the overall trends of source data,, while providing strong privacy guarantees to individuals that contributed to the source dataset. DP synthetic data can unlock the value of datasets that have previously been inaccessible due to privacy concerns and can replace the use of sensitive datasets that previously have only had rudimentary protections like ad-hoc rule-based anonymization.
  In this paper we explore the full suite of techniques surrounding DP synthetic data, the types of privacy protections they offer and the state-of-the-art for various modalities (image, tabular, text and decentralized). We outline all the components needed in a system that generates DP synthetic data, from sensitive data handling and preparation, to tracking the use and empirical privacy testing. We hope that work will result in increased adoption of DP synthetic data, spur additional research and increase trust in DP synthetic data approaches.

Conclusion: MAAG框架通过记忆机制实现了对新型越狱攻击的高效自适应检测，为大语言模型安全防护提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become foundational in AI systems, yet they remain vulnerable to adversarial jailbreak attacks. These attacks involve carefully crafted prompts that bypass safety guardrails and induce models to produce harmful content. Detecting such malicious input queries is therefore critical for maintaining LLM safety. Existing methods for jailbreak detection typically involve fine-tuning LLMs as static safety LLMs using fixed training datasets. However, these methods incur substantial computational costs when updating model parameters to improve robustness, especially in the face of novel jailbreak attacks. Inspired by immunological memory mechanisms, we propose the Multi-Agent Adaptive Guard (MAAG) framework for jailbreak detection. The core idea is to equip guard with memory capabilities: upon encountering novel jailbreak attacks, the system memorizes attack patterns, enabling it to rapidly and accurately identify similar threats in future encounters. Specifically, MAAG first extracts activation values from input prompts and compares them to historical activations stored in a memory bank for quick preliminary detection. A defense agent then simulates responses based on these detection results, and an auxiliary agent supervises the simulation process to provide secondary filtering of the detection outcomes. Extensive experiments across five open-source models demonstrate that MAAG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving 98% detection accuracy and a 96% F1-score across a diverse range of attack scenarios.

Motivation: 深度学习语义通信系统通过传输语义潜表示提升效率，但无线信道的开放性和潜表示的脆弱性带来新的安全风险，现有研究未充分关注潜空间层面的攻击。

Method: 提出DiR攻击（利用扩散模型重编码语义变体）和TTA-LM攻击（通过目标损失函数梯度扰动潜表示），两种方法均能保持潜表示统计特性以隐蔽攻击。

Result: 在多类语义通信架构上的实验表明，两种攻击均可显著改变解码语义（如将“狗”篡改为“猫”），同时保持潜空间分布自然，攻击隐蔽性强。

Conclusion: 语义通信的潜空间存在本质安全脆弱性，需构建兼顾语义完整性和安全性的新一代通信框架，未来应探索潜空间认证等防御机制。

Abstract: Deep learning-based semantic communication (SemCom) has emerged as a promising paradigm for next-generation wireless networks, offering superior transmission efficiency by extracting and conveying task-relevant semantic latent representations rather than raw data. However, the openness of the wireless medium and the intrinsic vulnerability of semantic latent representations expose such systems to previously unrecognized security risks. In this paper, we uncover a fundamental latent-space vulnerability that enables Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacker to covertly manipulate the transmitted semantics while preserving the statistical properties of the transmitted latent representations. We first present a Diffusion-based Re-encoding Attack (DiR), wherein the attacker employs a diffusion model to synthesize an attacker-designed semantic variant, and re-encodes it into a valid latent representation compatible with the SemCom decoder. Beyond this model-dependent pathway, we further propose a model-agnostic and training-free Test-Time Adaptation Latent Manipulation attack (TTA-LM), in which the attacker perturbs and steers the intercepted latent representation toward an attacker-specified semantic target by leveraging the gradient of a target loss function. In contrast to diffusion-based manipulation, TTA-LM does not rely on any generative model and does not impose modality-specific or task-specific assumptions, thereby enabling efficient and broadly applicable latent-space tampering across diverse SemCom architectures. Extensive experiments on representative semantic communication architectures demonstrate that both attacks can significantly alter the decoded semantics while preserving natural latent-space distributions, making the attacks covert and difficult to detect.

Motivation: 评估和改进对抗性风格测量攻击的有效性，通过识别最有效的风格特征来增强文本匿名化能力。

Method: 收集Reddit评论数据，使用TraceTarnish处理文本，通过StyloMetrix生成风格特征，应用信息增益准则筛选最具预测性的特征。

Result: 识别出五个关键风格特征作为可靠攻击指标：功能词频率、内容词分布和类型标记比。

Conclusion: 这些特征既可用来增强攻击效果，也可作为检测对抗性风格测量攻击的取证信标，但需要原始文本对比才能有效检测。

Abstract: In this study, we more rigorously evaluated our attack script $\textit{TraceTarnish}$, which leverages adversarial stylometry principles to anonymize the authorship of text-based messages. To ensure the efficacy and utility of our attack, we sourced, processed, and analyzed Reddit comments--comments that were later alchemized into $\textit{TraceTarnish}$ data--to gain valuable insights. The transformed $\textit{TraceTarnish}$ data was then further augmented by $\textit{StyloMetrix}$ to manufacture stylometric features--features that were culled using the Information Gain criterion, leaving only the most informative, predictive, and discriminative ones. Our results found that function words and function word types ($L\_FUNC\_A$ $\&$ $L\_FUNC\_T$); content words and content word types ($L\_CONT\_A$ $\&$ $L\_CONT\_T$); and the Type-Token Ratio ($ST\_TYPE\_TOKEN\_RATIO\_LEMMAS$) yielded significant Information-Gain readings. The identified stylometric cues--function-word frequencies, content-word distributions, and the Type-Token Ratio--serve as reliable indicators of compromise (IoCs), revealing when a text has been deliberately altered to mask its true author. Similarly, these features could function as forensic beacons, alerting defenders to the presence of an adversarial stylometry attack; granted, in the absence of the original message, this signal may go largely unnoticed, as it appears to depend on a pre- and post-transformation comparison. "In trying to erase a trace, you often imprint a larger one." Armed with this understanding, we framed $\textit{TraceTarnish}$'s operations and outputs around these five isolated features, using them to conceptualize and implement enhancements that further strengthen the attack.

Result: 新方案解决了用户识别需求，同时减少了凭证共享带来的安全风险

Conclusion: 改进的第三代GAS方案在保持匿名性的同时满足了特定应用的用户识别需求，但部分场景仍需依赖中央权威进行认证

Abstract: Group Authentication Schemes (GAS) are methodologies developed to verify the membership of multiple users simultaneously. These schemes enable the concurrent authentication of several users while eliminating the need for a certification authority. Numerous GAS methods have been explored in the literature, and they can be classified into three distinct generations based on their foundational mathematical principles. First-generation GASs rely on polynomial interpolation and the multiplicative subgroup of a finite field. Second-generation GASs also employ polynomial interpolation, but they distinguish themselves by incorporating elliptic curves over finite fields. While third-generation GASs present a promising solution for scalable environments, they demonstrate a limitation in certain applications. Such applications typically require the identification of users participating in the authentication process. In the third-generation GAS, users are able to verify their credentials while maintaining anonymity. However, there are various applications where the identification of participating users is necessary. In this study, we propose an improved version of third-generation GAS, utilizing inner product spaces and polynomial interpolation to resolve this limitation. We address the issue of preventing malicious actions by legitimate group members. The current third-generation scheme allows members to share group credentials, which can jeopardize group confidentiality. Our proposed scheme mitigates this risk by eliminating the ability of individual users to distribute credentials. However, a potential limitation of our scheme is its reliance on a central authority for authentication in certain scenarios.

Abstract: With the growing reliance on cloud services for large-scale data management, preserving the security and privacy of outsourced datasets has become increasingly critical. While encrypting data and queries can prevent direct content exposure, recent research reveals that adversaries can still infer sensitive information via access pattern and search path analysis. However, existing solutions that offer strong access pattern privacy often incur substantial performance overhead. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving range query scheme over encrypted datasets, offering strong security guarantees while maintaining high efficiency. To achieve this, we develop secure learned spatial index (SLS-INDEX), a secure learned index that integrates the Paillier cryptosystem with a hierarchical prediction architecture and noise-injected buckets, enabling data-aware query acceleration in the encrypted domain. To further obfuscate query execution paths, SLS-INDEXbased Range Queries (SLRQ) employs a permutation-based secure bucket prediction protocol. Additionally, we introduce a secure point extraction protocol that generates candidate results to reduce the overhead of secure computation. We provide formal security analysis under realistic leakage functions and implement a prototype to evaluate its practical performance. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that SLRQ significantly outperforms existing solutions in query efficiency while ensuring dataset, query, result, and access pattern privacy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for diverse applications. However, their uniform token processing paradigm introduces critical vulnerabilities in instruction handling, particularly when exposed to adversarial scenarios. In this work, we identify and propose a novel class of vulnerabilities, termed Tool-Completion Attack (TCA), which exploits function-calling mechanisms to subvert model behavior. To evaluate LLM robustness against such threats, we introduce the Tool-Completion benchmark, a comprehensive security assessment framework, which reveals that even state-of-the-art models remain susceptible to TCA, with surprisingly high attack success rates. To address these vulnerabilities, we introduce Context-Aware Hierarchical Learning (CAHL), a sophisticated mechanism that dynamically balances semantic comprehension with role-specific instruction constraints. CAHL leverages the contextual correlations between different instruction segments to establish a robust, context-aware instruction hierarchy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CAHL significantly enhances LLM robustness against both conventional attacks and the proposed TCA, exhibiting strong generalization capabilities in zero-shot evaluations while still preserving model performance on generic tasks.

Motivation: 上市公司和机构投资者持有比特币时面临证明偿付能力、管理风险和满足监管要求的压力，但需要在不暴露内部钱包结构或交易策略的情况下实现透明化。

Method: 构建理想化的TPL模型，将比特币资金库表示为多领域风险敞口向量，结合标准储备证明和转移证明技术，通过基于哈希的承诺锚定在比特币链上。

Conclusion: TPL框架能够支持负责任的透明政策，与比特币固定货币供应量一致，但需要明确当前尚无系统完全实现这些保证，结果属于存在性证明类型。

Abstract: Public companies and institutional investors that hold Bitcoin face increasing pressure to show solvency, manage risk, and satisfy regulatory expectations without exposing internal wallet structures or trading strategies. This paper introduces the Treasury Proof Ledger (TPL), a Bitcoin-anchored logging framework for multi-domain Bitcoin treasuries that treats on-chain and off-chain exposures as a conserved state machine with an explicit fee sink. A TPL instance records proof-of-reserves snapshots, proof-of-transit receipts for movements between domains, and policy metadata, and it supports restricted views based on stakeholder permissions. We define an idealised TPL model, represent Bitcoin treasuries as multi-domain exposure vectors, and give deployment-level security notions including exposure soundness, policy completeness, non-equivocation, and privacy-compatible policy views. We then outline how practical, restricted forms of these guarantees can be achieved by combining standard proof-of-reserves and proof-of-transit techniques with hash-based commitments anchored on Bitcoin. The results are existence-type statements: they show which guarantees are achievable once economic and governance assumptions are set, without claiming that any current system already provides them. A stylised corporate-treasury example illustrates how TPL could support responsible transparency policies and future cross-institution checks consistent with Bitcoin's fixed monetary supply.

Motivation: MCP协议缺乏内置加密安全保障，开发者自主实现的加密方案易出现误用，威胁敏感数据安全

Method: 提出跨语言中间表示统一加密API、混合依赖分析追踪函数关系、基于污点的误用检测器跟踪敏感数据流

Result: 在720个含加密逻辑的MCP服务器中，19.7%存在误用，Python语言误用率达34%，开发者工具和数据科学类应用占比超50%

Conclusion: 研究首次揭示MCP生态加密误用现状，为强化该协议安全基础提供工具和 insights

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is rapidly emerging as the middleware for LLM-based applications, offering a standardized interface for tool integration. However, its built-in security mechanisms are minimal: while schemas and declarations prevent malformed requests, MCP provides no guarantees of authenticity or confidentiality, forcing developers to implement cryptography themselves. Such ad hoc practices are historically prone to misuse, and within MCP they threaten sensitive data and services. We present MICRYSCOPE, the first domain-specific framework for detecting cryptographic misuses in MCP implementations. MICRYSCOPE combines three key innovations: a cross-language intermediate representation that normalizes cryptographic APIs across diverse ecosystems, a hybrid dependency analysis that uncovers explicit and implicit function relationships (including insecure runtime compositions orchestrated by LLMs) and a taint-based misuse detector that tracks sensitive data flows and flags violations of established cryptographic rules. Applying MICRYSCOPE to 9,403 MCP servers, we identified 720 with cryptographic logic, of which 19.7% exhibited misuses. These flaws are concentrated in certain markets (e.g., Smithery Registry with 42% insecure servers), languages (Python at 34% misuse rate), and categories (Developer Tools and Data Science & ML accounting for over 50% of all misuses). Case studies reveal real-world consequences, including leaked API keys, insecure DES/ECB tools, and MD5-based authentication bypasses. Our study establishes the first ecosystem-wide view of cryptographic misuse in MCP and provides both tools and insights to strengthen the security foundations of this rapidly growing protocol.

Abstract: Dynamic friction models (DFMs) encode essential information for the simulation and control of systems with friction. Traditionally, DFMs have been published with conceptual block diagrams, promoting clarity and reproducibility in simulation. However, modern DFMs have grown increasingly complex and block diagrams are now rarely presented, limiting accessibility. This letter presents a block diagram representation of the Generalized Maxwell Slip (GMS) friction model, an advanced multi-state DFM capable of simulating a wide range of nonlinear friction phenomena. The diagram can be implemented in the MATLAB-Simulink environment using a Stateflow chart or embedded if-else logic to represent the state transition criteria, but it is not limited to this platform. Closed-loop and open-loop simulations were conducted to verify that the block diagram reproduces non-drifting behavior and stick-slip friction, including benchmarking against the LuGre model. The proposed diagram improves accessibility to advanced dynamic friction models and provides the engineering community with a practical tool for the simulation and control of systems with friction.

Abstract: Risk communication seeks to develop a shared understanding of disaster among stakeholders, thereby amplifying public awareness and empowering them to respond more effectively to emergencies. However, existing studies have overemphasized specialized numerical modelling, making the professional output challenging to understand and use by non-research stakeholders. In this context, this article proposes a 3D virtual geographic environment for flood representation towards risk communication, which integrates flood modelling, parallel computation, and 3D representation in a pipeline. Finally, a section of the Rhine River in Bonn, Germany, is selected for experiment analysis. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is capable of flood modelling and 3D representation within a few hours, the parallel speedup ratio reached 6.45. The intuitive flood scene with 3D city models is beneficial for promoting flood risk communication and is particularly helpful for participants without direct experience of floods to understand its spatiotemporal process. It also can be embedded in the Geospatial Infrastructure Management Ecosystem (GeoIME) cloud application for intelligent flood systems.

*Hexiang Xu,Hengyuan Liu,Yonghao Wu,Xiaolan Kang,Xiang Chen,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）在初学者调试中的故障定位能力，发现具备推理能力的先进模型（如OpenAI o3、DeepSeekR1）表现优异，但存在过度推理和计算成本高的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新手程序员因经验不足在故障定位上面临困难，传统方法（如SBFL、MBFL）缺乏代码上下文理解能力，而LLMs能通过理解程序语法语义来突破这些局限。

Method: 使用Codeflaws、Condefects和新建的BugT数据集，评估6个闭源和7个开源LLMs，比较其在不同难度故障定位任务中的表现，并分析提示工程和推理能力的影响。

Result: 具备推理能力的LLMs（如o3、DeepSeekR1）在BugT数据集上保持稳健性能，准确率最高；无推理能力的模型（如GPT-4）需精细提示设计；问题难度增加时LLMs准确率下降，但顶级模型仍表现良好；新手参与者高度评价LLMs的解释价值。

Conclusion: LLMs有潜力提升调试效率，尤其适合辅助新手程序员，但需进一步优化推理能力和计算效率以投入实际应用。

Abstract: Novice programmers often face challenges in fault localization due to their limited experience and understanding of programming syntax and logic. Traditional methods like Spectrum-Based Fault Localization (SBFL) and Mutation-Based Fault Localization (MBFL) help identify faults but often lack the ability to understand code context, making them less effective for beginners. In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in overcoming these limitations by utilizing their ability to understand program syntax and semantics. LLM-based fault localization provides more accurate and context-aware results than traditional techniques. This study evaluates six closed-source and seven open-source LLMs using the Codeflaws, Condefects, and BugT datasets, with BugT being a newly constructed dataset specifically designed to mitigate data leakage concerns. Advanced models with reasoning capabilities, such as OpenAI o3 and DeepSeekR1, achieve superior accuracy with minimal reliance on prompt engineering. In contrast, models without reasoning capabilities, like GPT-4, require carefully designed prompts to maintain performance. While LLMs perform well in simple fault localization, their accuracy decreases as problem difficulty increases, though top models maintain robust performance in the BugT dataset. Over-reasoning is another challenge, where some models generate excessive explanations that hinder fault localization clarity. Additionally, the computational cost of deploying LLMs remains a significant barrier for real-time debugging. LLM's explanations demonstrate significant value for novice programmer assistance, with one-year experience participants consistently rating them highly. Our findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs to improve debugging efficiency while stressing the need for further refinement in their reasoning and computational efficiency for practical adoption.

TL;DR: Causify Dev系统提出了一种混合方法，结合了单体仓库和多仓库的优点，通过可运行目录实现开发效率和代码库可维护性的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统代码库组织策略面临扩展性问题——单体仓库存在工具复杂性和可扩展性挑战，多仓库则在协调和依赖管理方面存在困难。

Method: 引入可运行目录作为独立可执行单元，每个目录拥有完整的开发、测试和部署生命周期，并基于统一环境、共享工具和容器化Docker工作流实现隔离依赖和高效CI/CD。

Result: 该方法在一致性和模块化之间取得了平衡，提升了复杂代码库的可靠性和可维护性。

Conclusion: Causify Dev为不断增长的大型代码库提供了一种实用的中间方案，有效解决了传统代码组织策略的局限性。

Abstract: Modern software systems increasingly strain traditional codebase organization strategies. Monorepos offer consistency but often suffer from scalability issues and tooling complexity, while multi-repos provide modularity at the cost of coordination and dependency management challenges. As an answer to this trade-off, we present the Causify Dev system, a hybrid approach that integrates key benefits of both. Its central concept is the runnable directory -- a self-contained, independently executable unit with its own development, testing, and deployment lifecycles. Backed by a unified thin environment, shared helper utilities, and containerized Docker-based workflows, runnable directories enable consistent setups, isolated dependencies, and efficient CI/CD processes. The Causify Dev approach provides a practical middle ground between monorepo and multi-repo strategies, improving reliability and maintainability for growing, complex codebases.

TL;DR: 通过对1000多个开源项目的分析发现，开源库的安全漏洞普遍存在且多为传递性依赖，关键漏洞平均存在超过一年才被修复。软件成分分析工具能有效识别依赖漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着开源库的广泛使用，其引入的安全漏洞风险日益突出（如Log4Shell事件），需要系统性研究漏洞的分布、持续时间和修复情况。

Method: 使用VODA工具爬取2013-2023年间1000多个GitHub项目的版本历史（含约5万个发行版），涵盖Java、Python等多语言，分析依赖版本、深度和已知漏洞的演变。

Result: 数据集较前人研究更大多样，发现多数语言的漏洞依赖是传递性的，关键漏洞平均持续超一年；漏洞持续时间和项目指标（如团队规模、发布周期）存在相关性。

Conclusion: 开源项目需更积极主动地管理依赖漏洞，软件成分分析工具对提升软件供应链安全至关重要，建议开发者定期扫描和更新依赖。

Abstract: Open-source libraries are widely used by software developers to speed up the development of products, however, they can introduce security vulnerabilities, leading to incidents like Log4Shell. With the expanding usage of open-source libraries, it becomes even more imperative to comprehend and address these dependency vulnerabilities. The use of Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools does greatly help here as they provide a deep insight on what dependencies are used in a project, enhancing the security and integrity in the software supply chain. In order to learn how wide spread vulnerabilities are and how quickly they are being fixed, we conducted a study on over 1k open-source software projects with about 50k releases comprising several languages such as Java, Python, Rust, Go, Ruby, PHP, and JavaScript. Our objective is to investigate the severity, persistence, and distribution of these vulnerabilities, as well as their correlation with project metrics such as team and contributors size, activity and release cycles. In order to perform such analysis, we crawled over 1k projects from github including their version history ranging from 2013 to 2023 using VODA, our SCA tool. Using our approach, we can provide information such as library versions, dependency depth, and known vulnerabilities, and how they evolved over the software development cycle. Being larger and more diverse than datasets used in earlier works and studies, ours provides better insights and generalizability of the gained results. The data collected answers several research questions about the dependency depth and the average time a vulnerability persists. Among other findings, we observed that for most programming languages, vulnerable dependencies are transitive, and a critical vulnerability persists in average for over a year before being fixed.
