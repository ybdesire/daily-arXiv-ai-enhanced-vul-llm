Abstract: The convergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) inference pipelines with cloud infrastructure creates a dual attack surface where cloud security standards and AI governance frameworks intersect without unified enforcement mechanisms. AI governance, cloud security, and industrial control system standards intersect without unified enforcement, leaving hybrid deployments exposed to cross-layer attacks that threaten safety-critical operations. This paper makes three primary contributions: (i) we synthesize these frameworks into a lifecycle-staged threat taxonomy structured around explicit attacker capability tiers, (ii) we propose a Unified Reference Architecture spanning a Secure Data Factory, a hardened model supply chain, and a runtime governance layer, (iii) we present a case study through Grid-Guard, a hybrid Transmission System Operator scenario in which coordinated defenses drawn from NIST AI RMF, MITRE ATLAS, OWASP AI Exchange and GenAI, CSA MAESTRO, and NERC CIP defeat a multi-tier physical-financial manipulation campaign without human intervention. Controls are mapped against all five frameworks and current NERC CIP standards to demonstrate that a single cloud-native architecture can simultaneously satisfy AI governance, adversarial robustness, agentic safety, and industrial regulatory compliance obligations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in code generation, yet they remain prone to producing security vulnerabilities. Existing approaches commonly suffer from two key limitations: the scarcity of high-quality security data and coarse-grained reinforcement learning reward signals. To address these challenges, we propose Vul2Safe, a new secure code generation framework that leverages LLM self-reflection to construct high-confidence repair pairs from real-world vulnerabilities, and further generates diverse implicit prompts to build the PrimeVul+ dataset. Meanwhile, we introduce SRCode, a novel training framework that pioneers the use of token-level rewards in reinforcement learning for code security, which enables the model to continuously attend to and reinforce critical fine-grained security patterns during training. Compared with traditional instance-level reward schemes, our approach allows for more precise optimization of local security implementations. Extensive experiments show that PrimeVul+ and SRCode substantially reduce security vulnerabilities in generated code while improving overall code quality across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Wi-Fi deauthentication attacks remain a practical denial-of-service (DoS) threat by exploiting unprotected management frames to disrupt client connectivity. In this work, we introduce a software-defined testbed to measure Wi-Fi resilience to deauthentication attacks. We experimentally evaluate five wireless security configurations: open networks, WPA1, WPA2 without Protected Management Frames (PMF), WPA2 with PMF, and WPA3. Using controlled experiments, we measure client disconnection rates, packet injection volume, and time-to-disruption under each configuration. Packet-level behavior is analyzed using standard wireless auditing tools. Open networks, WPA1, and WPA2 without PMF proved entirely vulnerable to deauthentication, while no successful attacks were observed for WPA2 with PMF or WPA3 under tested conditions. These findings confirm the effectiveness of management-frame protection and highlight the continued risk posed by legacy or misconfigured wireless deployments.

Abstract: Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) is a cornerstone technique for ensuring privacy in deep learning, widely used in both training from scratch and fine-tuning large-scale language models. While DP-SGD predominantly relies on the Gaussian mechanism, the Laplace mechanism remains underutilized due to its reliance on L1 norm clipping. This constraint severely limits its practicality in high-dimensional models because the L1 norm of an n-dimensional gradient can be up to sqrt(n) times larger than its L2 norm. As a result, the required noise scale grows significantly with model size, leading to poor utility or untrainable models.
  In this work, we introduce Lap2, a new solution that enables L2 clipping for Laplace DP-SGD while preserving strong privacy guarantees. We overcome the dimensionality-driven clipping barrier by computing coordinate-wise moment bounds and applying majorization theory to construct a tight, data-independent upper bound over the full model. By exploiting the Schur-convexity of the moment accountant function, we aggregate these bounds using a carefully designed majorization set that respects the L2 clipping constraint. This yields a multivariate privacy accountant that scales gracefully with model dimension and enables the use of thousands of moments. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the performance of Laplace DP-SGD, achieving results comparable to or better than Gaussian DP-SGD under strong privacy constraints. For instance, fine-tuning RoBERTa-base (125M parameters) on SST-2 achieves 87.88% accuracy at epsilon=0.54, outperforming Gaussian (87.16%) and standard Laplace (48.97%) under the same budget.

Abstract: Tor onion services rely on long-lived introduction circuits to support anonymous rendezvous between clients and services. Although Tor includes some defenses against traffic analysis, the introduction protocol retains deterministic routing structure that can be leveraged by an adversary. We describe a practical intersection attack on Tor introduction circuits that can, over repeated interactions, identify each hop from the introduction point toward the onion service while requiring observation at only one relay per stage. The attack issues repeated probes and intersects destination IP address sets observed within narrowly defined \texttt{INTRODUCE1}--\texttt{RENDEZVOUS2} time windows, without assuming global visibility or access to packet payloads. We evaluate feasibility with live-network experiments using a self-operated onion service and relays, and we follow data-minimization and ethical safeguards throughout. The results show reliable convergence in practice, with the rate affected by consensus weight, and time-varying background traffic. We also assess practicality under a partial-global adversary model and discuss implications in light of the geographic concentration of Tor relay weight across cooperating jurisdictions.

Abstract: In the realm of quantum computing, quantum circuits serve as essential depictions of quantum algorithms, which are then compiled into executable operations for quantum computations. Quantum compilers are responsible for converting these algorithmic quantum circuits into versions compatible with specific quantum hardware, thus connecting quantum software with hardware. Nevertheless, untrusted quantum compilers present notable threats. They have the potential to result in the theft of quantum circuit designs and jeopardize sensitive intellectual property (IP). In this work, we propose CLOAQ, a quantum circuit obfuscation (QCO) approach that hides the logic and the phase angles of selected gates within the obfuscated quantum circuit. To evaluate the effectiveness of CLOAQ, we sample the input state uniformly from the Hilbert space of all qubits, which is more accurate than prior work that use all-|0> inputs. Our results show that CLOAQ benefits from the synergy between logic and phase protections. Compared with prior QCO approaches using only one perspective, the combined method is more resilient to attacks and causes greater functional disruption when the unlocking key is incorrect.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation transfers large teacher models to compact student models, enabling deployment on resource-limited platforms while suffering minimal performance degradation. However, this paradigm could lead to various security risks, especially model theft. Existing defenses against model theft, such as watermarking and secure enclaves, focus primarily on identity authentication and incur significant resource costs. Aiming to provide post-theft accountability and traceability, we propose a novel fingerprinting framework that superimposes device-specific Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) signatures onto teacher logits during distillation. Compared with watermarking or secure enclaves, our approach is lightweight, requires no architectural changes, and enables traceability of any leaked or cloned model. Since the signatures are based on PUFs, this framework is robust against reverse engineering and tampering attacks. In this framework, the signature recovery process consists of two stages: first a neural network-based decoder and then a Hamming distance decoder. Furthermore, we also propose a bit compression scheme to support a large number of devices. Experiment results demonstrate that our framework achieves high key recovery rate and negligible accuracy loss while allowing a tunable trade-off between these two key metrics. These results show that the proposed framework is a practical and robust solution for protecting distilled models.

Abstract: In an age of financial system digitisation and the increasing adoption of digital currencies, Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) have emerged as a focal point for technological innovation. Privacy compliance has become a key factor in the successful design of CBDCs, extending beyond technical requirements to influence legal requirements, user trust, and security considerations. Implementing Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) in CBDCs requires an interdisciplinary approach, however, the lack of a common understanding of privacy and the essential technological characteristics restricts progress. This work investigates: (1) How privacy can be defined within the framework of CBDCs and what implications does this definition have for CBDCs design? and (2) Which PETs can be employed to enhance privacy in CBDC design? We propose a comprehensive definition for privacy that is mapped to the cryptographic landscape for feature implementation. The research is validated against case studies from 20 current CBDCs. The study shows that comprehensive privacy can be designed in the proposal stage, but that privacy does not reach the launched version of the CBDC.

Abstract: Driven by the widespread deployment of distributed energy resources, local energy markets (LEMs) have emerged as a promising approach for enabling direct trades among prosumers and consumers to balance intermittent generation and demand locally. However, LEMs involve processing sensitive participant data, which, if not protected, poses privacy risks. At the same time, since electricity is exchanged over the physical power network, market mechanisms should consider physical constraints and network-related costs. Existing work typically addresses these issues separately, either by incorporating grid-related aspects or by providing privacy protection. To address this gap, we propose a privacy-preserving protocol for LEMs, with consideration of network fees that can incite participants to respect physical limits. The protocol is based on a double-auction mechanism adapted from prior work to enable more efficient application of our privacy-preserving approach. To protect participants' data, we use secure multiparty computation. In addition, Schnorr's identification protocol is employed with multiparty verification to ensure authenticated participation without compromising privacy. We further optimise the protocol to reduce communication and round complexity. We prove that the protocol meets its security requirements and show through experimentation its feasibility at a typical LEM scale: a market with 5,000 participants can be cleared in 4.17 minutes.

Abstract: Drone Remote Identification (RID) plays a critical role in low-altitude airspace supervision, yet its broadcast nature and lack of cryptographic protection make it vulnerable to spoofing and replay attacks. In this paper, we propose a consistency verification-based physical-layer authentication (PLA) algorithm for drone RID frames. A RID-aware sensing and decoding module is first developed to extract communication-derived sensing parameters, including angle-of-arrival, Doppler shift, average channel gain, and the number of transmit antennas, together with the identity and motion-related information decoded from previously authenticated RID frames. Rather than fusing all heterogeneous information into a single representation, different types of information are selectively utilized according to their physical relevance and reliability. Specifically, real-time wireless sensing parameter constraints and previously authenticated motion states are incorporated in a yaw-augmented constant-acceleration extended Kalman filter (CA-EKF) to estimate the three-dimensional position and motion states of the drone. To further enhance authentication reliability under highly maneuverable and non-stationary flight scenarios, a data-driven long short-term memory-based motion estimator is employed, and its predictions are adaptively combined with the CA-EKF via an error-aware fusion strategy. Finally, RID frames are authenticated by verifying consistency in the number of transmit antennas, motion estimates, and no-fly-zone constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly improves authentication reliability and robustness under realistic wireless impairments and complex drone maneuvers, outperforming existing RF feature-based and motion model-based PLA schemes.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Selective image encryption is common in remote sensing systems because it protects sensitive regions of interest (ROI) while limiting computational cost. However, many selective designs enable cross-tile structural leakage under chosen-plaintext attacks when secret-dependent transformations are reused across spatial positions. This paper proposes Tilewise Domain-Separated Selective Encryption (TDS-SE), where per-tile (and optionally per-frame) keys are derived from a master secret via HKDF with explicit domain separation, and ROI masks are treated strictly as external side information. Structural leakage is evaluated using two reconstruction-based distinguishers -- a linear model and a lightweight convolutional neural network -- under multiple attack settings. Experiments on RESISC45 and SEN12MS cover ablation tests, cross-position transferability, cross-sample generalization, and ROI-knowledge asymmetry. Results show that per-tile domain separation reduces position-conditioned transfer for the linear probe, and that adding frame freshness improves robustness to imperfect ROI assumptions for the CNN probe. Cross-sample generalization exhibits mixed behavior across settings, consistent with an empirical evaluation perspective, while selective-encryption functionality is preserved under the same tiling and ROI policy. Beyond the method itself, the paper provides a structured protocol for evaluating selective encryption under realistic attacker capabilities.

Abstract: Recent work applies Large Language Models (LLMs) to source-code vulnerability detection, but most evaluations still rely on random train-test splits that ignore time and overestimate real-world performance. In practice, detectors are deployed on evolving code bases and must recognise future vulnerabilities under temporal distribution shift. This paper investigates continual fine-tuning of a decoder-style language model (microsoft/phi-2 with LoRA) on a CVE-linked dataset spanning 2018-2024, organised into bi-monthly windows. We evaluate eight continual learning strategies, including window-only and cumulative training, replay-based baselines and regularisation-based variants. We propose Hybrid Class-Aware Selective Replay (Hybrid-CASR), a confidence-aware replay method for binary vulnerability classification that prioritises uncertain samples while maintaining a balanced ratio of VULNERABLE and FIXED functions in the replay buffer. On bi-monthly forward evaluation Hybrid-CASR achieves a Macro-F1 of 0.667, improving on the window-only baseline (0.651) by 0.016 with statistically significant gains ($p = 0.026$) and stronger backward retention (IBR@1 of 0.741). Hybrid-CASR also reduces training time per window by about 17 percent compared to the baseline, whereas cumulative training delivers only a minor F1 increase (0.661) at a 15.9-fold computational cost. Overall, the results show that selective replay with class balancing offers a practical accuracy-efficiency trade-off for LLM-based temporal vulnerability detection under continuous temporal drift.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of Industrial IoT (IIoT) systems has amplified security challenges, as heterogeneous devices and dynamic traffic patterns increase exposure to sophisticated and previously unseen cyberattacks. Traditional intrusion detection systems often struggle in such environments due to their reliance on extensive labeled data and limited ability to detect new threats. To address these challenges, we propose MI$^2$DAS, a multi-layer intrusion detection framework that integrates anomaly-based hierarchical traffic pooling, open-set recognition to distinguish between known and unknown attacks and incremental learning for adapting to novel attack types with minimal labeling. Experiments conducted on the Edge-IIoTset dataset demonstrate strong performance across all layers. In the first layer, GMM achieves superior normal-attack discrimination (accuracy = 0.953, TPR = 1.000). In open-set recognition, GMM attains a recall of 0.813 for known attacks, while LOF achieves 0.882 recall for unknown attacks. For fine-grained classification of known attacks, Random Forest achieves a macro-F1 of 0.941. Finally, the incremental learning module maintains robust performance when incorporation novel attack classes, achieving a macro-F1 of 0.8995. These results showcase MI$^2$DAS as an effective, scalable and adaptive framework for enhancing IIoT security against evolving threats.

Abstract: Cross-domain intrusion detection remains a critical challenge due to significant variability in network traffic characteristics and feature distributions across environments. This study evaluates the transferability of three widely used flow-based feature sets (Argus, Zeek and CICFlowMeter) across four widely used datasets representing heterogeneous IoT and Industrial IoT network conditions. Through extensive experiments, we evaluate in- and cross-domain performance across multiple classification models and analyze feature importance using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Our results show that models trained on one domain suffer significant performance degradation when applied to a different target domain, reflecting the sensitivity of IoT intrusion detection systems to distribution shifts. Furthermore, the results evidence that the choice of classification algorithm and feature representations significantly impact transferability. Beyond reporting performance differences and thorough analysis of the transferability of features and feature spaces, we provide practical guidelines for feature engineering to improve robustness under domain variability. Our findings suggest that effective intrusion detection requires both high in-domain performance and resilience to cross-domain variability, achievable through careful feature space design, appropriate algorithm selection and adaptive strategies.

Abstract: Jailbreak techniques for large language models (LLMs) evolve faster than benchmarks, making robustness estimates stale and difficult to compare across papers due to drift in datasets, harnesses, and judging protocols. We introduce JAILBREAK FOUNDRY (JBF), a system that addresses this gap via a multi-agent workflow to translate jailbreak papers into executable modules for immediate evaluation within a unified harness. JBF features three core components: (i) JBF-LIB for shared contracts and reusable utilities; (ii) JBF-FORGE for the multi-agent paper-to-module translation; and (iii) JBF-EVAL for standardizing evaluations. Across 30 reproduced attacks, JBF achieves high fidelity with a mean (reproduced-reported) attack success rate (ASR) deviation of +0.26 percentage points. By leveraging shared infrastructure, JBF reduces attack-specific implementation code by nearly half relative to original repositories and achieves an 82.5% mean reused-code ratio. This system enables a standardized AdvBench evaluation of all 30 attacks across 10 victim models using a consistent GPT-4o judge. By automating both attack integration and standardized evaluation, JBF offers a scalable solution for creating living benchmarks that keep pace with the rapidly shifting security landscape.

Abstract: Recently, RISC-V has contributed to the development of IoT devices, requiring architectures that balance energy efficiency, compact area, and integrated security. However, most recent RISC-V cores for IoT prioritize either area footprint or energy efficiency, while adding cryptographic support further compromises compactness. As a result, truly integrated architectures that simultaneously optimize efficiency and security remain largely unexplored, leaving constrained IoT environments vulnerable to performance and security trade-offs. In this paper, we introduce SAILOR, an energy-efficient and scalable ultra-lightweight RISC-V core family for cryptographic applications in IoT. Our design is modular and spans 1-, 2-, 4-, 8-, 16-, and 32-bit serialized execution data-paths, prioritizing minimal area. This modular design and adaptable data-path minimizes the overhead of integrating RISC-V cryptography extensions, achieving low hardware cost while significantly improving energy efficiency. We validate our design approach through a comprehensive analysis of area, energy, and efficiency trade-offs. The results surpass state-of-the-art solutions in both performance and energy efficiency by up to 13x and reduce area by up to 59 %, demonstrating that lightweight cryptographic features can be added without prohibitive overhead, and that energy- or area-efficient designs need not compromise performance.

Abstract: Job-based smishing scams, where victims are recruited under the guise of remote job opportunities, represent a rapidly growing and understudied threat within the broader landscape of online fraud. In this paper, we present Anansi, the first scalable, end-to-end measurement pipeline designed to systematically engage with, analyze, and characterize job scams in the wild. Anansi combines large language models (LLMs), automated browser agents, and infrastructure fingerprinting tools to collect over 29,000 scam messages, interact with more than 1900 scammers, and extract behavioral, financial, and infrastructural signals at scale. We detail the operational workflows of scammers, uncover extensive reuse of message templates, domains, and cryptocurrency wallets, and identify the social engineering tactics used to defraud victims. Our analysis reveals millions of dollars in cryptocurrency losses, highlighting the use of deceptive techniques such as domain fronting and impersonation of well-known brands. Anansi demonstrates the feasibility and value of automating the engagement with scammers and the analysis of infrastructure, offering a new methodological foundation for studying large-scale fraud ecosystems.

Abstract: Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers contain a collection of thousands of open-source standardized tools, linking LLMs to external systems; however, existing datasets and benchmarks lack realistic, human-like user queries, remaining a critical gap in evaluating the tool usage and ecosystems of MCP servers. Existing datasets often do contain tool descriptions but fail to represent how different users portray their requests, leading to poor generalization and inflated reliability of certain benchmarks. This paper introduces the first large-scale MCP dataset featuring diverse, high-quality diverse user queries generated specifically to match 2800 tools across 308 MCP servers, developing on the MCP Zero dataset. Each tool is paired with multiple unique user personas that we have generated, to capture varying levels of user intent ranging from precise task requests, and ambiguous, exploratory commands, reflecting the complexity of real-world interaction patterns.

Abstract: Adverse media screening is a critical component of anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) compliance processes in financial institutions. Traditional approaches rely on keyword-based searches that generate high false-positive rates or require extensive manual review. We present an agentic system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to automate adverse media screening. Our system implements a multi-step approach where an LLM agent searches the web, retrieves and processes relevant documents, and computes an Adverse Media Index (AMI) score for each subject. We evaluate our approach using multiple LLM backends on a dataset comprising Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs), persons from regulatory watchlists, and sanctioned persons from OpenSanctions and clean names from academic sources, demonstrating the system's ability to distinguish between high-risk and low-risk individuals.

Abstract: Previous work establishing completeness results for $\textit{counterfactual identification}$ has been circumscribed to the setting where the input data belongs to observational or interventional distributions (Layers 1 and 2 of Pearl's Causal Hierarchy), since it was generally presumed impossible to obtain data from counterfactual distributions, which belong to Layer 3. However, recent work (Raghavan & Bareinboim, 2025) has formally characterized a family of counterfactual distributions which can be directly estimated via experimental methods - a notion they call $\textit{counterfactual realizabilty}$. This leaves open the question of what $\textit{additional}$ counterfactual quantities now become identifiable, given this new access to (some) Layer 3 data. To answer this question, we develop the CTFIDU+ algorithm for identifying counterfactual queries from an arbitrary set of Layer 3 distributions, and prove that it is complete for this task. Building on this, we establish the theoretical limit of which counterfactuals can be identified from physically realizable distributions, thus implying the $\textit{fundamental limit to exact causal inference in the non-parametric setting}$. Finally, given the impossibility of identifying certain critical types of counterfactuals, we derive novel analytic bounds for such quantities using realizable counterfactual data, and corroborate using simulations that counterfactual data helps tighten the bounds for non-identifiable quantities in practice.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In the real world, planning is often challenged by distribution shifts. As such, a model of the environment obtained under one set of conditions may no longer remain valid as the distribution of states or the environment dynamics change, which in turn causes previously learned strategies to fail. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework for planning under partial observability using Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) formulated using causal knowledge. By representing shifts in the environment as interventions on this causal POMDP, the framework enables evaluating plans under hypothesized changes and actively identifying which components of the environment have been altered. We show how to maintain and update a belief over both the latent state and the underlying domain, and we prove that the value function remains piecewise linear and convex (PWLC) in this augmented belief space. Preservation of PWLC under distribution shifts has the advantage of maintaining the tractability of planning via $α$-vector-based POMDP methods.

Abstract: The Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem (mTSP) extends the Traveling Salesman Problem to m tours that start and end at a common depot and jointly visit all customers exactly once. In the min-max variant, the objective is to minimize the longest tour, reflecting workload balance. We propose a hybrid approach, Construct, Merge, Solve & Adapt with Reinforcement Learning (RL-CMSA), for the symmetric single-depot min-max mTSP. The method iteratively constructs diverse solutions using probabilistic clustering guided by learned pairwise q-values, merges routes into a compact pool, solves a restricted set-covering MILP, and refines solutions via inter-route remove, shift, and swap moves. The q-values are updated by reinforcing city-pair co-occurrences in high-quality solutions, while the pool is adapted through ageing and pruning. This combination of exact optimization and reinforcement-guided construction balances exploration and exploitation. Computational results on random and TSPLIB instances show that RL-CMSA consistently finds (near-)best solutions and outperforms a state-of-the-art hybrid genetic algorithm under comparable time limits, especially as instance size and the number of salesmen increase.

Abstract: We present SleepLM, a family of sleep-language foundation models that enable human sleep alignment, interpretation, and interaction with natural language. Despite the critical role of sleep, learning-based sleep analysis systems operate in closed label spaces (e.g., predefined stages or events) and fail to describe, query, or generalize to novel sleep phenomena. SleepLM bridges natural language and multimodal polysomnography, enabling language-grounded representations of sleep physiology. To support this alignment, we introduce a multilevel sleep caption generation pipeline that enables the curation of the first large-scale sleep-text dataset, comprising over 100K hours of data from more than 10,000 individuals. Furthermore, we present a unified pretraining objective that combines contrastive alignment, caption generation, and signal reconstruction to better capture physiological fidelity and cross-modal interactions. Extensive experiments on real-world sleep understanding tasks verify that SleepLM outperforms state-of-the-art in zero-shot and few-shot learning, cross-modal retrieval, and sleep captioning. Importantly, SleepLM also exhibits intriguing capabilities including language-guided event localization, targeted insight generation, and zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks. All code and data will be open-sourced.

Abstract: Synthesizing high-quality training data is crucial for enhancing domain models' reasoning abilities. Existing methods face limitations in long-tail knowledge coverage, effectiveness verification, and interpretability. Knowledge-graph-based approaches still fall short in functionality, granularity, customizability, and evaluation. To address these issues, we propose MMKG-RDS, a flexible framework for reasoning data synthesis that leverages multimodal knowledge graphs. It supports fine-grained knowledge extraction, customizable path sampling, and multidimensional data quality scoring. We validate MMKG-RDS with the MMKG-RDS-Bench dataset, covering five domains, 17 task types, and 14,950 samples. Experimental results show fine-tuning Qwen3 models (0.6B/8B/32B) on a small number of synthesized samples improves reasoning accuracy by 9.2%. The framework also generates distinct data, challenging existing models on tasks involving tables and formulas, useful for complex benchmark construction. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/360AILAB-NLP/MMKG-RDS

Abstract: Everyone from AI executives and researchers to doomsayers, politicians, and activists is talking about Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Yet, they often don't seem to agree on its exact definition. One common definition of AGI is an AI that can do everything a human can do, but are humans truly general? In this paper, we address what's wrong with our conception of AGI, and why, even in its most coherent formulation, it is a flawed concept to describe the future of AI. We explore whether the most widely accepted definitions are plausible, useful, and truly general. We argue that AI must embrace specialization, rather than strive for generality, and in its specialization strive for superhuman performance, and introduce Superhuman Adaptable Intelligence (SAI). SAI is defined as intelligence that can learn to exceed humans at anything important that we can do, and that can fill in the skill gaps where humans are incapable. We then lay out how SAI can help hone a discussion around AI that was blurred by an overloaded definition of AGI, and extrapolate the implications of using it as a guide for the future.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents typically rely on reactive decision-making paradigms such as ReAct, selecting actions conditioned on growing execution histories. While effective for short tasks, these approaches often lead to redundant tool usage, unstable reasoning, and high token consumption in complex long-horizon tasks involving branching, iteration, or multi-tool coordination. To address these limitations, this paper introduces PseudoAct, a novel framework for flexible planning and action control in LLM agents through pseudocode synthesis. Leveraging the ability of LLMs to express task-solving strategies as code, PseudoAct synthesizes a structured pseudocode plan that decomposes a task into subtasks and explicitly encodes control flow, including sequencing, conditionals, loops, parallel composition, and combinations of these logic primitives. Actions are then executed by following this global plan, making the decision logic explicit and temporally coherent. This design reduces redundant actions, prevents infinite loops, and avoids uninformative alternative exploration, enabling consistent and efficient long-horizon decision-making. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method significantly outperforms existing reactive agent approaches, achieving a 20.93% absolute gain in success rate on FEVER and setting a new state-of-the-art on HotpotQA.

Abstract: The paradigm of large language model (LLM) reasoning is shifting from parameter scaling to test-time compute scaling, yet many existing approaches still rely on uniform brute-force sampling (for example, fixed best-of-N or self-consistency) that is costly, hard to attribute, and can trigger overthinking with diminishing returns. We propose ODAR-Expert, an adaptive routing framework that optimizes the accuracy-efficiency trade-off via principled resource allocation. ODAR uses a difficulty estimator grounded in amortized active inference to dynamically route queries between a heuristic Fast Agent and a deliberative Slow Agent. We further introduce a free-energy-principled, risk-sensitive fusion mechanism that selects answers by minimizing a variational free energy objective, balancing log-likelihood with epistemic uncertainty (varentropy) as a principled alternative to ad hoc voting over heterogeneous candidates. Extensive evaluation across 23 benchmarks shows strong and consistent gains, including 98.2% accuracy on MATH and 54.8% on Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), while improving the compute-accuracy frontier under compute-matched settings. We also validate reproducibility on a fully open-source stack (Llama 4 + DeepSeek), where ODAR surpasses homogeneous sampling strategies while reducing computational costs by 82%. Overall, our results suggest that thinking-optimal scaling requires adaptive resource allocation with free-energy-based decision-making rather than simply increasing test-time compute.

Abstract: LLM-powered Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex domains but suffer from inherent fragility and opaque failure mechanisms. Existing failure attribution methods, whether relying on direct prompting, costly replays, or supervised fine-tuning, typically treat execution logs as flat sequences. This linear perspective fails to disentangle the intricate causal links inherent to MAS, leading to weak observability and ambiguous responsibility boundaries. To address these challenges, we propose CHIEF, a novel framework that transforms chaotic trajectories into a structured hierarchical causal graph. It then employs hierarchical oracle-guided backtracking to efficiently prune the search space via sybthesized virtual oracles. Finally, it implements counterfactual attribution via a progressive causal screening strategy to rigorously distinguish true root causes from propagated symptoms. Experiments on Who&When benchmark show that CHIEF outperforms eight strong and state-of-the-art baselines on both agent- and step-level accuracy. Ablation studies further confirm the critical role of each proposed module.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents show promise for e-commerce conversational shopping, yet existing implementations lack the interaction depth and contextual breadth required for complex product research. Meanwhile, the Deep Research paradigm, despite advancing information synthesis in web search, suffers from domain gaps when transferred to e-commerce. We propose ProductResearch, a multi-agent framework that synthesizes high-fidelity, long-horizon tool-use trajectories for training robust e-commerce shopping agents. The framework employs a User Agent to infer nuanced shopping intents from behavioral histories, and a Supervisor Agent that orchestrates iterative collaboration with a Research Agent to generate synthetic trajectories culminating in comprehensive, insightful product research reports. These trajectories are rigorously filtered and distilled through a reflective internalization process that consolidates multi-agent supervisory interactions into coherent single-role training examples, enabling effective fine-tuning of LLM agents for complex shopping inquiries. Extensive experiments show that a compact MoE model fine-tuned on our synthetic data achieves substantial improvements over its base model in response comprehensiveness, research depth, and user-perceived utility, approaching the performance of frontier proprietary deep research systems and establishing multi-agent synthetic trajectory training as an effective and scalable paradigm for enhancing LLM-based shopping assistance.

Abstract: The field of Artificial Intelligence is undergoing a transition from Generative AI -- probabilistic generation of text and images -- to Agentic AI, in which autonomous systems execute actions within external environments on behalf of users. This transition exposes a fundamental architectural mismatch: Large Language Models (LLMs) produce stochastic, unstructured outputs, whereas the backend infrastructure they must control -- databases, APIs, cloud services -- requires deterministic, schema-conformant inputs. The present paper describes the Auton Agentic AI Framework, a principled architecture for standardizing the creation, execution, and governance of autonomous agent systems. The framework is organized around a strict separation between the Cognitive Blueprint, a declarative, language-agnostic specification of agent identity and capabilities, and the Runtime Engine, the platform-specific execution substrate that instantiates and runs the agent. This separation enables cross-language portability, formal auditability, and modular tool integration via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The paper formalizes the agent execution model as an augmented Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) with a latent reasoning space, introduces a hierarchical memory consolidation architecture inspired by biological episodic memory systems, defines a constraint manifold formalism for safety enforcement via policy projection rather than post-hoc filtering, presents a three-level self-evolution framework spanning in-context adaptation through reinforcement learning, and describes runtime optimizations -- including parallel graph execution, speculative inference, and dynamic context pruning -- that reduce end-to-end latency for multi-step agent workflows.

Abstract: This paper proposes CIRCLE, a six-stage, lifecycle-based framework to bridge the reality gap between model-centric performance metrics and AI's materialized outcomes in deployment. While existing frameworks like MLOps focus on system stability and benchmarks measure abstract capabilities, decision-makers outside the AI stack lack systematic evidence about the behavior of AI technologies under real-world user variability and constraints. CIRCLE operationalizes the Validation phase of TEVV (Test, Evaluation, Verification, and Validation) by formalizing the translation of stakeholder concerns outside the stack into measurable signals. Unlike participatory design, which often remains localized, or algorithmic audits, which are often retrospective, CIRCLE provides a structured, prospective protocol for linking context-sensitive qualitative insights to scalable quantitative metrics. By integrating methods such as field testing, red teaming, and longitudinal studies into a coordinated pipeline, CIRCLE produces systematic knowledge: evidence that is comparable across sites yet sensitive to local context. This can enable governance based on materialized downstream effects rather than theoretical capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) pursue omni-perception capabilities, yet integrating robust sensory grounding with complex reasoning remains a challenge, particularly for underrepresented regions. In this report, we introduce the research preview of MERaLiON2-Omni (Alpha), a 10B-parameter multilingual omni-perception tailored for Southeast Asia (SEA). We present a progressive training pipeline that explicitly decouples and then integrates "System 1" (Perception) and "System 2" (Reasoning) capabilities. First, we establish a robust Perception Backbone by aligning region-specific audio-visual cues (e.g., Singlish code-switching, local cultural landmarks) with a multilingual LLM through orthogonal modality adaptation. Second, to inject cognitive capabilities without large-scale supervision, we propose a cost-effective Generate-Judge-Refine pipeline. By utilizing a Super-LLM to filter hallucinations and resolve conflicts via a consensus mechanism, we synthesize high-quality silver data that transfers textual Chain-of-Thought reasoning to multimodal scenarios.
  Comprehensive evaluation on our newly introduced SEA-Omni Benchmark Suite reveals an Efficiency-Stability Paradox: while reasoning acts as a non-linear amplifier for abstract tasks (boosting mathematical and instruction-following performance significantly), it introduces instability in low-level sensory processing. Specifically, we identify Temporal Drift in long-context audio, where extended reasoning desynchronizes the model from acoustic timestamps, and Visual Over-interpretation, where logic overrides pixel-level reality. This report details the architecture, the data-efficient training recipe, and a diagnostic analysis of the trade-offs between robust perception and structured reasoning.

Abstract: This paper addresses the domain generalization (DG) problem in deep learning. While most DG methods focus on enforcing visual feature invariance, we leverage the reasoning capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and explore the potential of constructing reasoning chains that derives image categories to achieve more robust predictions under domain shift. To this end, we systematically study the role of reasoning in DG using DomainBed-Reasoning, a newly constructed extension of DomainBed dataset, in which each sample is paired with class-relevant reasoning chains. Our analysis reveals two key challenges: (i) fine-tuning MLLMs with reasoning chains for classification is more challenging than direct label supervision, since the model must optimize complex reasoning sequences before label prediction; and (ii) mismatches in reasoning patterns between supervision signals and fine-tuned MLLMs lead to a trade-off between semantic richness (informative but harder to optimize) and optimization efficiency (easier to optimize but less informative). To address these issues, we propose RD-MLDG (Reasoning-Driven Multimodal LLM for Domain Generalization), a framework with two components: (i) MTCT (Multi-Task Cross-Training), which introduces an additional direct classification pathway to guide reasoning supervision; and (ii) SARR (Self-Aligned Reasoning Regularization), which preserves the semantic richness of reasoning chains while mitigating reasoning-pattern mismatches via iterative self-labeling. Experiments on standard DomainBed datasets (PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, TerraInc) demonstrate that RD-MLDG achieves state-of-the-art performances, highlighting reasoning as a promising complementary signal for robust out-of-domain generalization.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable progress in visual reasoning and understanding tasks but still struggle to capture the complexity and subjectivity of human emotions. Existing approaches based on supervised fine-tuning often suffer from limited generalization and poor interpretability, while reinforcement learning methods such as Group Relative Policy Optimization fail to align with the intrinsic characteristics of emotional cognition. To address these challenges, we propose Reflective Reinforcement Learning for Emotional Reasoning (EMO-R3), a framework designed to enhance the emotional reasoning ability of MLLMs. Specifically, we introduce Structured Emotional Thinking to guide the model to perform step-by-step emotional reasoning in a structured and interpretable manner, and design a Reflective Emotional Reward that enables the model to re-evaluate its reasoning based on visual-text consistency and emotional coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EMO-R3 significantly improves both the interpretability and emotional intelligence of MLLMs, achieving superior performance across multiple visual emotional understanding benchmarks.

Abstract: Designing efficient reward functions for low-level control tasks is a challenging problem. Recent research aims to reduce reliance on expert experience by using Large Language Models (LLMs) with task information to generate dense reward functions. These methods typically rely on training results as feedback, iteratively generating new reward functions with greedy or evolutionary algorithms. However, they suffer from poor utilization of historical feedback and inefficient search, resulting in limited improvements in complex control tasks. To address this challenge, we propose RF-Agent, a framework that treats LLMs as language agents and frames reward function design as a sequential decision-making process, enhancing optimization through better contextual reasoning. RF-Agent integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to manage the reward design and optimization process, leveraging the multi-stage contextual reasoning ability of LLMs. This approach better utilizes historical information and improves search efficiency to identify promising reward functions. Outstanding experimental results in 17 diverse low-level control tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The source code is available at https://github.com/deng-ai-lab/RF-Agent.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning aims to learn an agent from pre-collected datasets, avoiding unsafe and inefficient real-time interaction. However, inevitable access to out-ofdistribution actions during the learning process introduces approximation errors, causing the error accumulation and considerable overestimation. In this paper, we construct a new pessimistic auxiliary policy for sampling reliable actions. Specifically, we develop a pessimistic auxiliary strategy by maximizing the lower confidence bound of the Q-function. The pessimistic auxiliary strategy exhibits a relatively high value and low uncertainty in the vicinity of the learned policy, avoiding the learned policy sampling high-value actions with potentially high errors during the learning process. Less approximation error introduced by sampled action from pessimistic auxiliary strategy leads to the alleviation of error accumulation. Extensive experiments on offline reinforcement learning benchmarks reveal that utilizing the pessimistic auxiliary strategy can effectively improve the efficacy of other offline RL approaches.

Abstract: Market regime shifts induce distribution shifts that can degrade the performance of portfolio rebalancing policies. We propose macro-conditioned scenario-context rollout (SCR) that generates plausible next-day multivariate return scenarios under stress events. However, doing so faces new challenges, as history will never tell what would have happened differently. As a result, incorporating scenario-based rewards from rollouts introduces a reward--transition mismatch in temporal-difference learning, destabilizing RL critic training.
  We analyze this inconsistency and show it leads to a mixed evaluation target. Guided by this analysis, we construct a counterfactual next state using the rollout-implied continuations and augment the critic agent's bootstrap target. Doing so stabilizes the learning and provides a viable bias-variance tradeoff.
  In out-of-sample evaluations across 31 distinct universes of U.S. equity and ETF portfolios, our method improves Sharpe ratio by up to 76% and reduces maximum drawdown by up to 53% compared with classic and RL-based portfolio rebalancing baselines.

Abstract: The pursuit of human-like conversational agents has long been guided by the Turing test. For modern speech-to-speech (S2S) systems, a critical yet unanswered question is whether they can converse like humans. To tackle this, we conduct the first Turing test for S2S systems, collecting 2,968 human judgments on dialogues between 9 state-of-the-art S2S systems and 28 human participants. Our results deliver a clear finding: no existing evaluated S2S system passes the test, revealing a significant gap in human-likeness. To diagnose this failure, we develop a fine-grained taxonomy of 18 human-likeness dimensions and crowd-annotate our collected dialogues accordingly. Our analysis shows that the bottleneck is not semantic understanding but stems from paralinguistic features, emotional expressivity, and conversational persona. Furthermore, we find that off-the-shelf AI models perform unreliably as Turing test judges. In response, we propose an interpretable model that leverages the fine-grained human-likeness ratings and delivers accurate and transparent human-vs-machine discrimination, offering a powerful tool for automatic human-likeness evaluation. Our work establishes the first human-likeness evaluation for S2S systems and moves beyond binary outcomes to enable detailed diagnostic insights, paving the way for human-like improvements in conversational AI systems.

Abstract: Winter road maintenance is critical for ensuring public safety and reducing environmental impacts, yet existing methods struggle to manage large-scale routing problems effectively and mostly reply on human decision. This study presents a novel, scalable bi-level optimization framework, validated on real operational data on UK strategic road networks (M25, M6, A1), including interconnected local road networks in surrounding areas for vehicle traversing, as part of the highway operator's efforts to solve existing planning challenges. At the upper level, a reinforcement learning (RL) agent strategically partitions the road network into manageable clusters and optimally allocates resources from multiple depots. At the lower level, a multi-objective vehicle routing problem (VRP) is solved within each cluster, minimizing the maximum vehicle travel time and total carbon emissions. Unlike existing approaches, our method handles large-scale, real-world networks efficiently, explicitly incorporating vehicle-specific constraints, depot capacities, and road segment requirements. Results demonstrate significant improvements, including balanced workloads, reduced maximum travel times below the targeted two-hour threshold, lower emissions, and substantial cost savings. This study illustrates how advanced AI-driven bi-level optimization can directly enhance operational decision-making in real-world transportation and logistics.

Abstract: This paper presents the Artificial Agency Program (AAP), a position and research agenda for building AI systems as reality embedded, resource-bounded agents whose development is driven by curiosity-as-learning-progress under physical and computational constraints. The central thesis is that AI is most useful when treated as part of an extended human--tool system that increases sensing, understanding, and actuation capability while reducing friction at the interface between people, tools, and environments. The agenda unifies predictive compression, intrinsic motivation, empowerment and control, interface quality (unification), and language/self-communication as selective information bottlenecks. We formulate these ideas as a falsifiable program with explicit costs, staged experiments, and a concrete multimodal tokenized testbed in which an agent allocates limited budget among observation, action, and deliberation. The aim is to provide a conceptual and experimental framework that connects intrinsic motivation, information theory, thermodynamics, bounded rationality, and modern reasoning systems

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the complex reasoning capabilities of Large Reasoning Models. However, standard outcome-based supervision suffers from a critical limitation that penalizes trajectories that are largely correct but fail due to several missteps as heavily as completely erroneous ones. This coarse feedback signal causes the model to discard valuable largely correct rollouts, leading to a degradation in rollout diversity that prematurely narrows the exploration space. Process Reward Models have demonstrated efficacy in providing reliable step-wise verification for test-time scaling, naively integrating these signals into RLVR as dense rewards proves ineffective.Prior methods attempt to introduce off-policy guided whole-trajectory replacement that often outside the policy model's distribution, but still fail to utilize the largely correct rollouts generated by the model itself and thus do not effectively mitigate the narrowing of the exploration space. To address these issues, we propose SCOPE (Step-wise Correction for On-Policy Exploration), a novel framework that utilizes Process Reward Models to pinpoint the first erroneous step in suboptimal rollouts and applies fine-grained, step-wise off-policy rectification. By applying precise refinement on partially correct rollout, our method effectively salvages partially correct trajectories and increases diversity score by 13.5%, thereby sustaining a broad exploration space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach establishes new state-of-the-art results, achieving an average accuracy of 46.6% on math reasoning and exhibiting robust generalization with 53.4% accuracy on out-of-distribution reasoning tasks.

Abstract: We present a new approach for benchmarking Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities on research-level mathematics. Existing benchmarks largely rely on static, hand-curated sets of contest or textbook-style problems as proxies for mathematical research. Instead, we establish an updatable benchmark evaluating models directly on the latest research results in mathematics. This consists of an automatic pipeline that extracts lemmas from arXiv and rewrites them into self-contained statements by making all assumptions and required definitions explicit. It results in a benchmark that can be updated regularly with new problems taken directly from human mathematical research, while previous instances can be used for training without compromising future evaluations. We benchmark current state-of-the-art LLMs, which obtain around 10-15$\%$ accuracy in theorem proving (pass@1) depending on the model, showing that there is currently a large margin of progression for LLMs to reach human-level proving capabilities in a research context.

Abstract: Despite their capabilities, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) may produce plausible but erroneous outputs, hindering reliable deployment. Accurate uncertainty metrics could enable escalation of unreliable queries to human experts or larger models for improved performance. However, existing uncertainty metrics have practical constraints, such as being designed only for specific modalities, reliant on external tools, or computationally expensive. We introduce UMPIRE, a training-free uncertainty quantification framework for MLLMs that works efficiently across various input and output modalities without external tools, relying only on the models' own internal modality features. UMPIRE computes the incoherence-adjusted semantic volume of sampled MLLM responses for a given task instance, effectively capturing both the global semantic diversity of samples and the local incoherence of responses based on internal model confidence. We propose uncertainty desiderata for MLLMs and provide theoretical analysis motivating UMPIRE's design. Extensive experiments show that UMPIRE consistently outperforms baseline metrics in error detection and uncertainty calibration across image, audio, and video-text benchmarks, including adversarial and out-of-distribution settings. We also demonstrate UMPIRE's generalization to non-text output tasks, including image and audio generation.

Abstract: We propose a minimal agentic baseline that enables systematic comparison across different AI-based theorem prover architectures. This design implements the core features shared among state-of-the-art systems: iterative proof refinement, library search and context management. We evaluate our baseline using qualitatively different benchmarks and compare various popular models and design choices, and demonstrate competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while using a significantly simpler architecture. Our results demonstrate consistent advantages of an iterative approach over multiple single-shot generations, especially in terms of sample efficiency and cost effectiveness. The implementation is released open-source as a candidate reference for future research and as an accessible prover for the community.

Abstract: The fast-growing demands in using Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle complex multi-step data science tasks create an emergent need for accurate benchmarking. There are two major gaps in existing benchmarks: (i) the lack of standardized, process-aware evaluation that captures instruction adherence and process fidelity, and (ii) the scarcity of accurately labeled training data. To bridge these gaps, we introduce DARE-bench, a benchmark designed for machine learning modeling and data science instruction following. Unlike many existing benchmarks that rely on human- or model-based judges, all tasks in DARE-bench have verifiable ground truth, ensuring objective and reproducible evaluation. To cover a broad range of tasks and support agentic tools, DARE-bench consists of 6,300 Kaggle-derived tasks and provides both large-scale training data and evaluation sets. Extensive evaluations show that even highly capable models such as gpt-o4-mini struggle to achieve good performance, especially in machine learning modeling tasks. Using DARE-bench training tasks for fine-tuning can substantially improve model performance. For example, supervised fine-tuning boosts Qwen3-32B's accuracy by 1.83x and reinforcement learning boosts Qwen3-4B's accuracy by more than 8x. These significant improvements verify the importance of DARE-bench both as an accurate evaluation benchmark and critical training data.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the emergence of intelligent agents capable of autonomously interacting with environments and invoking external tools. Recently, agent-based software repair approaches have received widespread attention, as repair agents can automatically analyze and localize bugs, generate patches, and achieve state-of-the-art performance on repository-level benchmarks. However, existing approaches usually adopt a localize-then-fix paradigm, jumping directly from "where the bug is" to "how to fix it", leaving a fundamental reasoning gap. To this end, we propose SGAgent, a Suggestion-Guided multi-Agent framework for repository-level software repair, which follows a localize-suggest-fix paradigm. SGAgent introduces a suggestion phase to strengthen the transition from localization to repair. The suggester starts from the buggy locations and incrementally retrieves relevant context until it fully understands the bug, and then provides actionable repair suggestions. Moreover, we construct a Knowledge Graph from the target repository and develop a KG-based toolkit to enhance SGAgent's global contextual awareness and repository-level reasoning. Three specialized sub-agents (i.e., localizer, suggester, and fixer) collaborate to achieve automated end-to-end software repair. Experimental results on SWE-Bench show that SGAgent with Claude-3.5 achieves 51.3% repair accuracy, 81.2% file-level and 52.4% function-level localization accuracy with an average cost of $1.48 per instance, outperforming all baselines using the same base model. Furthermore, SGAgent attains 48% accuracy on VUL4J and VJBench for vulnerability repair, demonstrating strong generalization across tasks and programming languages.

Abstract: Software engineering agents (SWE) are improving rapidly, with recent gains largely driven by reinforcement learning (RL). However, RL training is constrained by the scarcity of large-scale task collections with reproducible execution environments and reliable test suites. Although a growing number of benchmarks have emerged, datasets suitable for training remain limited in scale and diversity or often target a limited set of high-resource language ecosystems. We introduce SWE-rebench V2, a language-agnostic automated pipeline for harvesting executable real-world SWE tasks and constructing RL training environments at scale. The pipeline synthesizes repository-specific installation and test procedures via an interactive setup agent, and filters unsound instances using an ensemble of LLM judges, validated against human-verified SWE-bench annotations. Using this pipeline, we construct a dataset of 32,000+ tasks spanning 20 languages and 3,600+ repositories, with pre-built images for reproducible execution. To further scale training data, we additionally release 120,000+ tasks with installation instructions, fail-to-pass tests and rich metadata, where the problem statement is generated based on the original pull request description. We validate the collected instances through a diagnostic study that covers a subset of tasks in five programming languages across seven popular models, and provide instance-level metadata that flags common confounders such as overly restrictive tests and underspecified descriptions. We release the datasets, the collection and execution code, and associated artifacts to enable large-scale training of SWE agents across diverse languages and repositories.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: AI coding agents allow software developers to generate code quickly, which raises a practical question for project managers and open source maintainers: can vibe coders with less development experience substitute for expert developers? To explore whether developer experience still matters in AI-assisted development, we study $22,953$ Pull Requests (PRs) from $1,719$ vibe coders in the GitHub repositories of the AIDev dataset. We split vibe coders into lower experience vibe coders ($\mathit{Exp}_{Low}$) and higher experience vibe coders ($\mathit{Exp}_{High}$) and compare contribution magnitude and PR acceptance rates across PR categories. We find that $\mathit{Exp}_{Low}$ submits PRs with larger volume ($2.15\times$ more commits and $1.47\times$ more files changed) than $\mathit{Exp}_{High}$. Moreover, $\mathit{Exp}_{Low}$ PRs, when compared to $\mathit{Exp}_{High}$, receive $4.52\times$ more review comments, and have $31\%$ lower acceptance rates, and remain open $5.16\times$ longer before resolution. Our results indicate that low-experienced vibe coders focus on generating more code while shifting verification burden onto reviewers. For practice, project managers may not be able to safely replace experienced developers with low-experience vibe coders without increasing review capacity. Development teams should therefore combine targeted training for novices with adaptive PR review cycles.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Background. Automated test execution is an important activity to gather information about the quality of a software project. So-called flaky tests, however, negatively affect this process. Such tests fail seemingly at random without changes to the code and thus do not provide a clear signal. Previous work proposed to identify flaky tests based on the source code identifiers in the test code. So far, these approaches have not been evaluated in a large-scale industrial setting. Aims. We evaluate approaches to identify flaky tests and their root causes based on source code identifiers in the test code in a large-scale industrial project. Method. First, we replicate previous work by Pinto et al. in the context of SAP HANA. Second, we assess different feature extraction techniques, namely TF-IDF and TF-IDFC-RF. Third, we evaluate CodeBERT and XGBoost as classification models. For a sound comparison, we utilize both the data set from previous work and two data sets from SAP HANA. Results. Our replication shows similar results on the original data set and on one of the SAP HANA data sets. While the original approach yielded an F1-Score of 0.94 on the original data set and 0.92 on the SAP HANA data set, our extensions achieve F1-Scores of 0.96 and 0.99, respectively. The reliance on external data sources is a common root cause for test flakiness in the context of SAP HANA. Conclusions. The vocabulary of a large industrial project seems to be slightly different with respect to the exact terms, but the categories for the terms, such as remote dependencies, are similar to previous empirical findings. However, even with rather large F1-Scores, both finding source code identifiers for flakiness and a black box prediction have limited use in practice as the results are not actionable for developers.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Functional testing is essential for verifying that the business logic of mobile applications aligns with user requirements, serving as the primary methodology for quality assurance in software development. Despite its importance, functional testing remains heavily dependent on manual effort due to two core challenges. First, acquiring and reusing complex business logic from unstructured requirements remains difficult, which hinders the understanding of specific functionalities. Second, a significant semantic gap exists when adapting business logic to the diverse GUI environments, which hinders the generation of test cases for specific mobile applications. To address the preceding challenges, we propose LogiDroid, a two-stage approach that generates individual functional test cases by extracting business logic and adapting it to target applications. First, in the Knowledge Retrieval and Fusion stage, we construct a dataset to retrieve relevant cases and extract business logic for the target functionality. Second, in the Context-Aware Test Generation stage, LogiDroid jointly analyzes the extracted business logic and the real-time GUI environment to generate functional test cases. This design allows LogiDroid to accurately understand application semantics and use domain expertise to generate complete test cases with verification assertions. We assess the effectiveness of LogiDroid using two widely-used datasets that cover 28 real-world applications and 190 functional requirements. Experimental results show that LogiDroid successfully tested 40% of functional requirements on the FrUITeR dataset (an improvement of over 48% compared to the state-of-the-art approaches) and 65% on the Lin dataset (an improvement of over 55% compared to the state-of-the-art approaches). These results demonstrate the significant effectiveness of LogiDroid in functional test generation.
