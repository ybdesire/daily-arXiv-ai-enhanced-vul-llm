Traditionally, DFMs have been published with conceptual block diagrams, promoting clarity and reproducibility in simulation. However, modern DFMs have grown increasingly complex and block diagrams are now rarely presented, limiting accessibility. This letter presents a block diagram representation of the Generalized Maxwell Slip (GMS) friction model, an advanced multi-state DFM capable of simulating a wide range of nonlinear friction phenomena. The diagram can be implemented in the MATLAB-Simulink environment using a Stateflow chart or embedded if-else logic to represent the state transition criteria, but it is not limited to this platform. Closed-loop and open-loop simulations were conducted to verify that the block diagram reproduces non-drifting behavior and stick-slip friction, including benchmarking against the LuGre model. The proposed diagram improves accessibility to advanced dynamic friction models and provides the engineering community with a practical tool for the simulation and control of systems with friction."}

This paper presents a comprehensive study on intrusion detection in networks using classical machine learning algorithms applied to the multiclass version of the NSL-KDD dataset (Normal, DoS, Probe, R2L, and U2R classes). The characteristics of NSL-KDD are described in detail, including its variants and class distribution, and the data preprocessing process (cleaning, coding, and normalization) is documented. Four supervised classification models were implemented: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost, whose performance is evaluated using standard metrics (accuracy, recall, F1 score, confusion matrix, and area under the ROC curve). Experiments show that models based on tree sets (Random Forest and XGBoost) achieve the best performance, with accuracies approaching 99%, significantly outperforming logistic regression and individual decision trees. The ability of each model to detect each attack category is also analyzed, highlighting the challenges in identifying rare attacks (R2L and U2R). Finally, the implications of the results are discussed, comparing them with the state of the art, and potential avenues for future research are proposed, such as the application of class balancing techniques and deep learning models to improve intrusion detection."}

Such optimization becomes unfeasible when it is focused on a global search requiring thousands of simulations to be evaluated. Here, we present a viable global shape optimization methodology based on multi-objective evolutionary algorithms accelerated by deep neural networks (DNNs). Our methodology alternates between evaluating simulations and utilizing the generated data to train DNNs with various architectures. When a suitable DNN architecture is identified, the DNN replaces the simulation in the rest of the global search. Our methodology was tested on five ZDT benchmark functions, showing itself at the level of and sometimes more flexible than other state-of-the-art acceleration approaches. Then, it was applied to a real-life optimization problem, namely the shape optimization of a single-phase ejector. Compared with a non-accelerated methodology, ours was able to save weeks of CPU time in solving this problem. To experimentally confirm the performance of the optimized ejector shapes, four of them were 3D printed and tested on the lab scale confirming the predicted performance. This suggests that our methodology could be used for acceleration of other real-life shape optimization problems."}

In this context, this article proposes a 3D virtual geographic environment for flood representation towards risk communication, which integrates flood modelling, parallel computation, and 3D representation in a pipeline. Finally, a section of the Rhine River in Bonn, Germany, is selected for experiment analysis. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is capable of flood modelling and 3D representation within a few hours, the parallel speedup ratio reached 6.45. The intuitive flood scene with 3D city models is beneficial for promoting flood risk communication and is particularly helpful for participants without direct experience of floods to understand its spatiotemporal process. It also can be embedded in the Geospatial Infrastructure Management Ecosystem (GeoIME) cloud application for intelligent flood systems."}

The paper makes three philosophical contributions. First, I articulate the ``specification trap'' argument demonstrating why content-based value specification appears structurally unstable due to the conjunction of the is-ought gap, value pluralism, and the extended frame problem. Second, I propose syntropy -- the recursive reduction of mutual uncertainty between agents through state alignment -- as an information-theoretic framework for understanding multi-agent alignment dynamics. Third, I establish a functional distinction between genuine and simulated moral capacity grounded in compatibilist theories of guidance control, coupled with an embodied experimental paradigm and verification regime providing operational criteria independent of phenomenological claims. This paper represents the philosophical component of a broader research program whose empirical validation is being developed in a separate project currently in preparation.

To answer this question, we propose SU S VI B E S, a benchmark consisting of 200 feature-request software engineering tasks from real-world open-source projects, which, when given to human programmers, led to vulnerable implementations. We evaluate multiple widely used coding agents with frontier models on this benchmark. Disturbingly, all agents perform poorly in terms of software security. Although 61% of the solutions from SWE-Agent with Claude 4 Sonnet are functionally correct, only 10.5% are secure. Further experiments demonstrate that preliminary security strategies, such as augmenting the feature request with vulnerability hints, cannot mitigate these security issues.

The collected data covers more than 55% of the DeFi market cap and is obtained exclusively by protocol executives, board members, or delegates. Insights support the view that protocol choices are tied to technological dependencies, where immutability of smart contracts amplifies lock-in, preventing agile switching among data providers.

Traditional methods like Spectrum-Based Fault Localization (SBFL) and Mutation-Based Fault Localization (MBFL) help identify faults but often lack the ability to understand code context, making them less effective for beginners. In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in overcoming these limitations by utilizing their ability to understand program syntax and semantics. LLM-based fault localization provides more accurate and context-aware results than traditional techniques. This study evaluates six closed-source and seven open-source LLMs using the Codeflaws, Condefects, and BugT datasets, with BugT being a newly constructed dataset specifically designed to mitigate data leakage concerns. Advanced models with reasoning capabilities, such as OpenAI o3 and DeepSeekR1, achieve superior accuracy with minimal reliance on prompt engineering. In contrast, models without reasoning capabilities, like GPT-4, require carefully designed prompts to maintain performance. While LLMs perform well in simple fault localization, their accuracy decreases as problem difficulty increases, though top models maintain robust performance in the BugT dataset. Over-reasoning is another challenge, where some models generate excessive explanations that hinder fault localization clarity. Additionally, the computational cost of deploying LLMs remains a significant barrier for real-time debugging. LLM's explanations demonstrate significant value for novice programmer assistance, with one-year experience participants consistently rating them highly. Our findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs to improve debugging efficiency while stressing the need for further refinement in their reasoning and computational efficiency for practical adoption."}

In many cases, it could be useful to have emergency shutdown mechanisms which effectively prevent misaligned agents from carrying out harmful actions in the world. We introduce password-activated shutdown protocols (PAS protocols) -- methods for designing frontier agents to implement a safe shutdown protocol when given a password. We motivate PAS protocols by describing intuitive use-cases in which they mitigate risks from misaligned systems that subvert other control efforts, for instance, by disabling automated monitors or self-exfiltrating to external data centres. PAS protocols supplement other safety efforts, such as alignment fine-tuning or monitoring, contributing to defence-in-depth against AI risk. We provide a concrete demonstration in SHADE-Arena, a benchmark for AI monitoring and subversion capabilities, in which PAS protocols supplement monitoring to increase safety with little cost to performance. Next, PAS protocols should be robust to malicious actors who want to bypass shutdown. Therefore, we conduct a red-team blue-team game between the developers (blue-team), who must implement a robust PAS protocol, and a red-team trying to subvert the protocol. We conduct experiments in a code-generation setting, finding that there are effective strategies for the red-team, such as using another model to filter inputs, or fine-tuning the model to prevent shutdown behaviour. We then outline key challenges to implementing PAS protocols in real-life systems, including: security considerations of the password and decisions regarding when, and in which systems, to use them. PAS protocols are an intuitive mechanism for increasing the safety of frontier AI. We encourage developers to consider implementing PAS protocols prior to internal deployment of particularly dangerous systems to reduce loss-of-control risks."}

A promising direction is the symbolic-solver-integrated approach, which leverages the code generation capabilities of LLMs to translate reasoning tasks into executable code and then solve them with a symbolic solver. In this paper, we explore an open question of when the conventional long-CoT can be enhanced by symbolic solvers. Our experimental results show that the symbolic-solver-integrated method only helps when the problem requires limited implicit reasoning but involves an ample search space. The latest LLMs, like GPT-4o, show better performance on deductive problems with shallow reasoning depth, while the symbolic-solver-integrated method significantly improves the LLMs' performance in constraint satisfaction problems that require repeated backtracks. When a declarative exemplar is provided, even CodeLlama-13B can outperform GPT-4o in difficult Zebra puzzles."}

We develop an experimental framework with scripted and unscripted doctor agents, adversarial assistants, and a verifier agent that checks decisions against clinical guidelines.

In the literature, the questions of how the preference distribution should be specified and of how a certain specification impacts inference and learning in an active inference agent have been given hardly any attention. In this work, we consider four possible ways of defining the preference distribution, either providing the agents with hard or soft goals and either involving or not goal shaping (i.e., intermediate goals). We compare the performances of four agents, each given one of the possible preference distributions, in a grid world navigation task. Our results show that goal shaping enables the best performance overall (i.e., it promotes exploitation) while sacrificing learning about the environment's transition dynamics (i.e., it hampers exploration)."}

In order to learn how wide spread vulnerabilities are and how quickly they are being fixed, we conducted a study on over 1k open-source software projects with about 50k releases comprising several languages such as Java, Python, Rust, Go, Ruby, PHP, and JavaScript. Our objective is to investigate the severity, persistence, and distribution of these vulnerabilities, as well as their correlation with project metrics such as team and contributors size, activity and release cycles. In order to perform such analysis, we crawled over 1k projects from github including their version history ranging from 2013 to 2023 using VODA, our SCA tool. Using our approach, we can provide information such as library versions, dependency depth, and known vulnerabilities, and how they evolved over the software development cycle. Being larger and more diverse than datasets used in earlier works and studies, ours provides better insights and generalizability of the gained results. The data collected answers several research questions about the dependency depth and the average time a vulnerability persists. Among other findings, we observed that for most programming languages, vulnerable dependencies are transitive, and a critical vulnerability persists in average for over a year before being fixed."}

In this paper, we introduce a method for evaluating the ability of LLM-based agents to cooperate in zero-shot, mixed-motive environments using Concordia, a natural language multi-agent simulation environment. Our method measures general cooperative intelligence by testing an agent's ability to identify and exploit opportunities for mutual gain across diverse partners and contexts.

Richer rewards computed from the reasoning tokens can improve learning significantly by providing more fine-grained guidance. However, it is challenging to compute more informative rewards in MMRL beyond those based on outcomes since different samples may require different scoring functions and teacher models may provide noisy reward signals too. In this paper, we introduce the Argos (Agentic Reward for Grounded & Objective Scoring), a principled reward agent to train multimodal reasoning models for agentic tasks. For each sample, Argos selects from a pool of teacher-model derived and rule-based scoring functions to simultaneously evaluate: (i) final response accuracy, (ii) spatiotemporal localization of referred entities and actions, and (iii) the quality of the reasoning process. We find that by leveraging our agentic verifier across both SFT data curation and RL training, our model achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple agentic tasks such as spatial reasoning, visual hallucination as well as robotics and embodied AI benchmarks. Critically, we demonstrate that just relying on SFT post-training on highly curated reasoning data is insufficient, as agents invariably collapse to ungrounded solutions during RL without our online verification.

However finding new sources of such data is getting harder: most publicly-available human generated data will soon have been used. Additionally, publicly available data often is not representative of users of a particular system -- for example, a research speech dataset of contractors interacting with an AI assistant will likely be more homogeneous, well articulated and self-censored than real world commands that end users will issue. Therefore unlocking high-quality data grounded in real user interactions is of vital interest. However, the direct use of user data comes with significant privacy risks. Differential Privacy (DP) is a well established framework for reasoning about and limiting information leakage, and is a gold standard for protecting user privacy. The focus of this work, \\emph{Differentially Private Synthetic data}, refers to synthetic data that preserves the overall trends of source data,, while providing strong privacy guarantees to individuals that contributed to the source dataset. DP synthetic data can unlock the value of datasets that have previously been inaccessible due to privacy concerns and can replace the use of sensitive datasets that previously have only had rudimentary protections like ad-hoc rule-based anonymization.\n  In this paper we explore the full suite of techniques surrounding DP synthetic data, the types of privacy protections they offer and the state-of-the-art for various modalities (image, tabular, text and decentralized). We outline all the components needed in a system that generates DP synthetic data, from sensitive data handling and preparation, to tracking the use and empirical privacy testing. We hope that work will result in increased adoption of DP synthetic data, spur additional research and increase trust in DP synthetic data approaches."}

This design enables PARC to detect and correct high-level strategic errors and sustain progress without human intervention. We evaluate PARC across computational science and data science tasks. In materials science, it autonomously reproduces key results from studies on lithium-ion conduction and alloy segregation. In particular, it coordinates dozens of parallel simulation tasks, each requiring roughly 43 hours of computation, managing orchestration, monitoring, and error correction end-to-end. In Kaggle-based experiments, starting from minimal natural-language instructions, PARC conducts data analysis and implements search strategies, producing solutions competitive with human-engineered baselines.

Graphical threat models are a recommended tool to analyze and communicate threat information.

We seek to compare the acceptability of three general, graphical threat models, Attack-Defense Trees (ADTs), Attack Graphs (AGs), and CORAS, for users with a limited technical background. We conducted a laboratory study with 38 bachelor students who completed tasks with the three threat models across three different scenarios assigned using a Latin square design. Threat model submissions were qualitatively analyzed, and participants filled out a perception questionnaire based on the Method Evaluation Model (MEM). We find that both ADTs and CORAS are broadly acceptable for a wide range of scenarios, and both could be applied successfully by users with a limited technical background; further, we also find that the lack of a specific tool for AGs may have impacted the perceived usefulness of AGs. We can recommend that users with a limited technical background use ADTs or CORAS as a general graphical TM method. Further research on the acceptability of AGs to such an audience and the effect of a dedicated TM tool support is needed."}

This struggle is driven by two main limitations. First, single-agent architectures enforce a monolithic plan-execute loop, which directly causes trajectory instability. Second, the requirement to use local open-weight models for data privacy introduces smaller context windows leading to the rapid consumption of context from large tool outputs. To solve this problem we introduce RP-ReAct (Reasoner Planner-ReAct), a novel multi-agent approach that fundamentally decouples strategic planning from low-level execution to achieve superior reliability and efficiency. RP-ReAct consists of a Reasoner Planner Agent (RPA), responsible for planning each sub-step, continuously analysing the execution results using the strong reasoning capabilities of a Large Reasoning Model, and one or multiple Proxy-Execution Agent (PEA) that translates sub-steps into concrete tool interactions using a ReAct approach. Crucially, we incorporate a context-saving strategy within the PEA to mitigate context window overflow by managing large tool outputs via external storage and on-demand access. We evaluate RP-ReAct, on the challenging, multi-domain ToolQA benchmark using a diverse set of six open-weight reasoning models. Our empirical results show that RP-ReAct achieves superior performance and improved generalization ability over state-of-the-art baselines when addressing diverse complex tasks across the evaluated domains. Furthermore we establish the enhanced robustness and stability of our approach across different model scales, paving the way for effective and deployable agentic solutions for enterprises."}

These attacks involve carefully crafted prompts that bypass safety guardrails and induce models to produce harmful content. Detecting such malicious input queries is therefore critical for maintaining LLM safety. Existing methods for jailbreak detection typically involve fine-tuning LLMs as static safety LLMs using fixed training datasets. However, these methods incur substantial computational costs when updating model parameters to improve robustness, especially in the face of novel jailbreak attacks. Inspired by immunological memory mechanisms, we propose the Multi-Agent Adaptive Guard (MAAG) framework for jailbreak detection. The core idea is to equip guard with memory capabilities: upon encountering novel jailbreak attacks, the system memorizes attack patterns, enabling it to rapidly and accurately identify similar threats in future encounters. Specifically, MAAG first extracts activation values from input prompts and compares them to historical activations stored in a memory bank for quick preliminary detection. A defense agent then simulates responses based on these detection results, and an auxiliary agent supervises the simulation process to provide secondary filtering of the detection outcomes. Extensive experiments across five open-source models demonstrate that MAAG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving 98% detection accuracy and a 96% F1-score across a diverse range of attack scenarios."}

We provide an implementation of PAN in Python as the EnCompass framework, which uses a Python decorator to compile agent workflow programs into a search space.

Addressing the systematic misalignment between existing theoretical models and real-world economic complexities, we identify three critical gaps: (1) data modality mismatch where unstructured textual sources (e.g. negotiation records, approval documents) impede accurate customer profiling; (2) dynamic feature entanglement challenges in modeling nonlinear price elasticity and time-varying attributes; (3) operational infeasibility caused by multi-tier business constraints.\n  Our framework introduces a tri-level architecture for above challenges. We design a hybrid knowledge fusion engine employing large language models (LLMs) for deep semantic parsing of unstructured text, transforming distributor agreements and sales assessments into structured features while integrating managerial expertise. Then a game-theoretic constrained optimization mechanism is employed to dynamically reconcile supply chain interests through bilateral utility functions, encoding manufacturer-distributor profit redistribution as endogenous objectives under hierarchical constraints. Finally an interpretable decision distillation interface leveraging LLM-guided symbolic regression to find and optimize pricing strategies and auditable business rules embeds economic priors (e.g. non-negative elasticity) as hard constraints during mathematical expression search. We validate the framework in real retail environments achieving higher profits versus systematic B2C baselines while ensuring operational feasibility. This establishes a close-loop pipeline unifying unstructured knowledge injection, multi-agent optimization, and interpretable strategy synthesis for real economic intelligence."}

However, the openness of the wireless medium and the intrinsic vulnerability of semantic latent representations expose such systems to previously unrecognized security risks. In this paper, we uncover a fundamental latent-space vulnerability that enables Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacker to covertly manipulate the transmitted semantics while preserving the statistical properties of the transmitted latent representations. We first present a Diffusion-based Re-encoding Attack (DiR), wherein the attacker employs a diffusion model to synthesize an attacker-designed semantic variant, and re-encodes it into a valid latent representation compatible with the SemCom decoder. Beyond this model-dependent pathway, we further propose a model-agnostic and training-free Test-Time Adaptation Latent Manipulation attack (TTA-LM), in which the attacker perturbs and steers the intercepted latent representation toward an attacker-specified semantic target by leveraging the gradient of a target loss function. In contrast to diffusion-based manipulation, TTA-LM does not rely on any generative model and does not impose modality-specific or task-specific assumptions, thereby enabling efficient and broadly applicable latent-space tampering across diverse SemCom architectures. Extensive experiments on representative semantic communication architectures demonstrate that both attacks can significantly alter the decoded semantics while preserving natural latent-space distributions, making the attacks covert and difficult to detect."}

To handle real-time demands, MemVerse introduces a periodic distillation mechanism that compresses essential knowledge from long-term memory into the parametric model, allowing fast, differentiable recall while preserving interpretability.

RoCo coordinates four specialized LLM-guided agents-explorer, exploiter, critic, and integrator-to collaboratively generate high-quality heuristics. The explorer promotes long-term potential through creative, diversity-driven thinking, while the exploiter focuses on short-term improvements via conservative, efficiency-oriented refinements. The critic evaluates the effectiveness of each evolution step and provides targeted feedback and reflection. The integrator synthesizes proposals from the explorer and exploiter, balancing innovation and exploitation to drive overall progress. These agents interact in a structured multi-round process involving feedback, refinement, and elite mutations guided by both short-term and accumulated long-term reflections. We evaluate RoCo on five different COPs under both white-box and black-box settings.

Conventional encryption techniques such as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) incur large area overheads and performance penalties, motivating lightweight XOR-based in-situ encryption schemes with low area and power requirements. This work proposes an ultra-dense single-transistor encrypted cell using ferroelectric FET (FeFET) devices, which, to our knowledge, is the first to eliminate the two-memory-devices-per-encrypted-cell requirement in XOR-based schemes, enabling encrypted memory arrays to maintain the same number of storage devices as unencrypted arrays. The key idea is an in-memory single-FeFET XOR scheme, where the ciphertext is encoded in the device threshold voltage and leverages the direction-dependent current flow of the FeFET for single-cycle decryption; eliminating complementary bit storage also removes the need for two write cycles, allowing faster encryption. We extend the approach to multi-level-cell (MLC) FeFETs to store multiple bits per transistor. We validate the proposed idea through both simulation and experimental evaluations. Our analysis on a 128x128-bit array shows 2x higher encryption/decryption throughput than prior FeFET work and 45.2x/14.12x improvement over AES, while application-level evaluations using neural-network benchmarks demonstrate average latency reductions of 50% and 95% compared to prior FeFET-based and AES-based schemes, respectively."}

To ensure the efficacy and utility of our attack, we sourced, processed, and analyzed Reddit comments--comments that were later alchemized into $\\textit{TraceTarnish}$ data--to gain valuable insights. The transformed $\\textit{TraceTarnish}$ data was then further augmented by $\\textit{StyloMetrix}$ to manufacture stylometric features--features that were culled using the Information Gain criterion, leaving only the most informative, predictive, and discriminative ones. Our results found that function words and function word types ($L\\_FUNC\\_A$ $\\&$ $L\\_FUNC\\_T$); content words and content word types ($L\\_CONT\\_A$ $\\&$ $L\\_CONT\\_T$); and the Type-Token Ratio ($ST\\_TYPE\\_TOKEN\\_RATIO\\_LEMMAS$) yielded significant Information-Gain readings. The identified stylometric cues--function-word frequencies, content-word distributions, and the Type-Token Ratio--serve as reliable indicators of compromise (IoCs), revealing when a text has been deliberately altered to mask its true author. Similarly, these features could function as forensic beacons, alerting defenders to the presence of an adversarial stylometry attack; granted, in the absence of the original message, this signal may go largely unnoticed, as it appears to depend on a pre- and post-transformation comparison. \"In trying to erase a trace, you often imprint a larger one.\" Armed with this understanding, we framed $\\textit{TraceTarnish}$'s operations and outputs around these five isolated features, using them to conceptualize and implement enhancements that further strengthen the attack."}

While prior work has primarily focused on ensuring compliance, our approach considers scenarios where deviating from policies may be necessary to achieve high-stakes goals. Additionally, modeling non-compliant behavior can assist policymakers by simulating realistic human decision-making. Our framework extends Gelfond and Lobo's Authorization and Obligation Policy Language (AOPL) to incorporate penalties and integrates Answer Set Programming (ASP) for reasoning. Compared to previous approaches, our method ensures well-formed policies, accounts for policy priorities, and enhances explainability by explicitly identifying rule violations and their consequences. Building on the work of Harders and Inclezan, we introduce penalty-based reasoning to distinguish between non-compliant plans, prioritizing those with minimal repercussions. To support this, we develop an automated translation from the extended AOPL into ASP and refine ASP-based planning algorithms to account for incurred penalties. Experiments in two domains demonstrate that our framework generates higher-quality plans that avoid harmful actions while, in some cases, also improving computational efficiency. These findings underscore its potential for enhancing autonomous decision-making and informing policy refinement. Under consideration in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)."}

These schemes enable the concurrent authentication of several users while eliminating the need for a certification authority. Numerous GAS methods have been explored in the literature, and they can be classified into three distinct generations based on their foundational mathematical principles. First-generation GASs rely on polynomial interpolation and the multiplicative subgroup of a finite field. Second-generation GASs also employ polynomial interpolation, but they distinguish themselves by incorporating elliptic curves over finite fields. While third-generation GASs present a promising solution for scalable environments, they demonstrate a limitation in certain applications. Such applications typically require the identification of users participating in the authentication process. In the third-generation GAS, users are able to verify their credentials while maintaining anonymity. However, there are various applications where the identification of participating users is necessary. In this study, we propose an improved version of third-generation GAS, utilizing inner product spaces and polynomial interpolation to resolve this limitation. We address the issue of preventing malicious actions by legitimate group members. The current third-generation scheme allows members to share group credentials, which can jeopardize group confidentiality. Our proposed scheme mitigates this risk by eliminating the ability of individual users to distribute credentials. However, a potential limitation of our scheme is its reliance on a central authority for authentication in certain scenarios."}

In many cases, it could be useful to have emergency shutdown mechanisms which effectively prevent misaligned agents from carrying out harmful actions in the world. We introduce password-activated shutdown protocols (PAS protocols) -- methods for designing frontier agents to implement a safe shutdown protocol when given a password. We motivate PAS protocols by describing intuitive use-cases in which they mitigate risks from misaligned systems that subvert other control efforts, for instance, by disabling automated monitors or self-exfiltrating to external data centres. PAS protocols supplement other safety efforts, such as alignment fine-tuning or monitoring, contributing to defence-in-depth against AI risk. We provide a concrete demonstration in SHADE-Arena, a benchmark for AI monitoring and subversion capabilities, in which PAS protocols supplement monitoring to increase safety with little cost to performance. Next, PAS protocols should be robust to malicious actors who want to bypass shutdown. Therefore, we conduct a red-team blue-team game between the developers (blue-team), who must implement a robust PAS protocol, and a red-team trying to subvert the protocol. We conduct experiments in a code-generation setting, finding that there are effective strategies for the red-team, such as using another model to filter inputs, or fine-tuning the model to prevent shutdown behaviour. We then outline key challenges to implementing PAS protocols in real-life systems, including: security considerations of the password and decisions regarding when, and in which systems, to use them. PAS protocols are an intuitive mechanism for increasing the safety of frontier AI. We encourage developers to consider implementing PAS protocols prior to internal deployment of particularly dangerous systems to reduce loss-of-control risks."}

Although game-theoretic, Bayesian, Markov decision process, and reinforcement learning models offer insight into deceptive interactions, they typically assume an attacker has already chosen to engage. Such approaches overlook cognitive and perceptual factors that influence an attacker's initial decision to engage or withdraw. This paper presents a descriptive model that incorporates the psychological and strategic elements shaping this decision. The model defines five components, belief (B), scepticism (S), deception fidelity (D), reconnaissance (R), and experience (E), which interact to capture how adversaries interpret deceptive cues and assess whether continued engagement is worthwhile. The framework provides a structured method for analysing engagement decisions in cyber-deception scenarios. A series of experiments has been designed to evaluate this model through Capture the Flag activities incorporating varying levels of deception, supported by behavioural and biometric observations. These experiments have not yet been conducted, and no experimental findings are presented in this paper. These experiments will combine behavioural observations with biometric indicators to produce a multidimensional view of adversarial responses. Findings will improve understanding of the factors influencing engagement decisions and refine the model's relevance to real-world cyber-deception settings. By addressing the gap in existing models that presume engagement, this work supports more cognitively realistic and strategically effective cyber-deception practices."}

However, while such knowledge injection improves performance, it also exposes new attack surfaces. Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), which aim to determine whether a given data sample was included in a model's training set, pose serious threats to privacy and trust in sensitive domains. To this end, we first systematically evaluate the vulnerability of RAG- and SFT-based LLMs to various MIAs. Then, to address the privacy risk, we further introduce a novel, model-agnostic defense framework, Ensemble Privacy Defense (EPD), which aggregates and evaluates the outputs of a knowledge-injected LLM, a base LLM, and a dedicated judge model to enhance resistance against MIAs. Comprehensive experiments show that, on average, EPD reduces MIA success by up to 27.8\\% for SFT and 526.3\\% for RAG compared to inference-time baseline, while maintaining answer quality."}

While encrypting data and queries can prevent direct content exposure, recent research reveals that adversaries can still infer sensitive information via access pattern and search path analysis. However, existing solutions that offer strong access pattern privacy often incur substantial performance overhead. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving range query scheme over encrypted datasets, offering strong security guarantees while maintaining high efficiency. To achieve this, we develop secure learned spatial index (SLS-INDEX), a secure learned index that integrates the Paillier cryptosystem with a hierarchical prediction architecture and noise-injected buckets, enabling data-aware query acceleration in the encrypted domain. To further obfuscate query execution paths, SLS-INDEXbased Range Queries (SLRQ) employs a permutation-based secure bucket prediction protocol. Additionally, we introduce a secure point extraction protocol that generates candidate results to reduce the overhead of secure computation. We provide formal security analysis under realistic leakage functions and implement a prototype to evaluate its practical performance. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that SLRQ significantly outperforms existing solutions in query efficiency while ensuring dataset, query, result, and access pattern privacy."}

We present the first comprehensive evaluation of extending these text-based MIA methods to multimodal settings. Our experiments under vision-and-text (V+T) and text-only (T-only) conditions across the DeepSeek-VL and InternVL model families show that in in-distribution settings, logit-based MIAs perform comparably across configurations, with a slight V+T advantage. Conversely, in out-of-distribution settings, visual inputs act as regularizers, effectively masking membership signals."}

However finding new sources of such data is getting harder: most publicly-available human generated data will soon have been used. Additionally, publicly available data often is not representative of users of a particular system -- for example, a research speech dataset of contractors interacting with an AI assistant will likely be more homogeneous, well articulated and self-censored than real world commands that end users will issue. Therefore unlocking high-quality data grounded in real user interactions is of vital interest. However, the direct use of user data comes with significant privacy risks. Differential Privacy (DP) is a well established framework for reasoning about and limiting information leakage, and is a gold standard for protecting user privacy. The focus of this work, \\emph{Differentially Private Synthetic data}, refers to synthetic data that preserves the overall trends of source data,, while providing strong privacy guarantees to individuals that contributed to the source dataset. DP synthetic data can unlock the value of datasets that have previously been inaccessible due to privacy concerns and can replace the use of sensitive datasets that previously have only had rudimentary protections like ad-hoc rule-based anonymization.\n  In this paper we explore the full suite of techniques surrounding DP synthetic data, the types of privacy protections they offer and the state-of-the-art for various modalities (image, tabular, text and decentralized). We outline all the components needed in a system that generates DP synthetic data, from sensitive data handling and preparation, to tracking the use and empirical privacy testing.

This paper introduces the Treasury Proof Ledger (TPL), a Bitcoin-anchored logging framework for multi-domain Bitcoin treasuries that treats on-chain and off-chain exposures as a conserved state machine with an explicit fee sink. A TPL instance records proof-of-reserves snapshots, proof-of-transit receipts for movements between domains, and policy metadata, and it supports restricted views based on stakeholder permissions. We define an idealised TPL model, represent Bitcoin treasuries as multi-domain exposure vectors, and give deployment-level security notions including exposure soundness, policy completeness, non-equivocation, and privacy-compatible policy views. We then outline how practical, restricted forms of these guarantees can be achieved by combining standard proof-of-reserves and proof-of-transit techniques with hash-based commitments anchored on Bitcoin. The results are existence-type statements: they show which guarantees are achievable once economic and governance assumptions are set, without claiming that any current system already provides them. A stylised corporate-treasury example illustrates how TPL could support responsible transparency policies and future cross-institution checks consistent with Bitcoin's fixed monetary supply."}

However, its built-in security mechanisms are minimal: while schemas and declarations prevent malformed requests, MCP provides no guarantees of authenticity or confidentiality, forcing developers to implement cryptography themselves. Such ad hoc practices are historically prone to misuse, and within MCP they threaten sensitive data and services. We present MICRYSCOPE, the first domain-specific framework for detecting cryptographic misuses in MCP implementations. MICRYSCOPE combines three key innovations: a cross-language intermediate representation that normalizes cryptographic APIs across diverse ecosystems, a hybrid dependency analysis that uncovers explicit and implicit function relationships (including insecure runtime compositions orchestrated by LLMs) and a taint-based misuse detector that tracks sensitive data flows and flags violations of established cryptographic rules. Applying MICRYSCOPE to 9,403 MCP servers, we identified 720 with cryptographic logic, of which 19.7% exhibited misuses. These flaws are concentrated in certain markets (e.g., Smithery Registry with 42% insecure servers), languages (Python at 34% misuse rate), and categories (Developer Tools and Data Science & ML accounting for over 50% of all misuses). Case studies reveal real-world consequences, including leaked API keys, insecure DES/ECB tools, and MD5-based authentication bypasses. Our study establishes the first ecosystem-wide view of cryptographic misuse in MCP and provides both tools and insights to strengthen the security foundations of this rapidly growing protocol."}

Similar to how multi-hop communication became fundamental in the evolution of the Internet, the demand for multi-hop cross-chain interactions is gaining increasing attention. However, this growing demand introduces new security and privacy challenges. On the security side, multi-hop interactions depend on the availability of multiple participating nodes. If any node becomes temporarily offline during execution, the protocol may fail to complete correctly, leading to settlement failure or fund loss. On the privacy side, the need for on-chain transparency to validate intermediate states may unintentionally leak linkable information, compromising the unlinkability of user interactions. In this paper, we propose the Cross-Chain Channel Network (CCN), a decentralized network designed to support secure and privacy-preserving multi-hop cross-chain transactions. Through experimental evaluation, we identify two critical types of offline failures, referred to as active and passive offline cases, which have not been adequately addressed by existing solutions. To mitigate these issues, we introduce R-HTLC, a core protocol within CCN. R-HTLC incorporates an hourglass mechanism and a multi-path refund strategy to ensure settlement correctness even when some nodes go offline during execution. Importantly, CCN addresses not only the correctness under offline conditions but also maintains unlinkability in such adversarial settings. To overcome this, CCN leverages zero-knowledge proofs and off-chain coordination, ensuring that interaction relationships remain indistinguishable even when certain nodes are temporarily offline."}

The use of Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools does greatly help here as they provide a deep insight on what dependencies are used in a project, enhancing the security and integrity in the software supply chain. In order to learn how wide spread vulnerabilities are and how quickly they are being fixed, we conducted a study on over 1k open-source software projects with about 50k releases comprising several languages such as Java, Python, Rust, Go, Ruby, PHP, and JavaScript. Our objective is to investigate the severity, persistence, and distribution of these vulnerabilities, as well as their correlation with project metrics such as team and contributors size, activity and release cycles. In order to perform such analysis, we crawled over 1k projects from github including their version history ranging from 2013 to 2023 using VODA, our SCA tool. Using our approach, we can provide information such as library versions, dependency depth, and known vulnerabilities, and how they evolved over the software development cycle. Being larger and more diverse than datasets used in earlier works and studies, ours provides better insights and generalizability of the gained results. The data collected answers several research questions about the dependency depth and the average time a vulnerability persists. Among other findings, we observed that for most programming languages, vulnerable dependencies are transitive, and a critical vulnerability persists in average for over a year before being fixed."}
