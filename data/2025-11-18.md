TL;DR: 论文提出了HetDAPAC框架，通过将非敏感属性验证集中化来改进DAPAC方案，提高了通信效率，同时保持敏感属性的隐私保护。

Motivation: DAPAC方案对所有属性采用严格的隐私约束，导致通信效率较低。现实中并非所有属性都敏感，需要区分处理以优化性能。

Method: 设计HetDAPAC框架，将N个属性中的N-D个非敏感属性验证交由中央服务器处理，仅对D个敏感属性采用分布式验证架构。

Result: 第一个方案将速率从1/(2K)提升到1/(K+1)，但存在服务器下载不平衡；第二个方案实现了服务器间下载平衡，速率为(D+1)/(2KD)。

Conclusion: 通过区分敏感和非敏感属性的隐私需求，HetDAPAC在保持隐私保护的同时显著提高了系统效率，为属性验证提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Verifying user attributes to provide fine-grained access control to databases is fundamental to attribute-based authentication. Either a single (central) authority verifies all the attributes, or multiple independent authorities verify the attributes distributedly. In the central setup, the authority verifies all user attributes, and the user downloads only the authorized record. While this is communication efficient, it reveals all user attributes to the authority. A distributed setup prevents this privacy breach by letting each authority verify and learn only one attribute. Motivated by this, Jafarpisheh~et~al. introduced an information-theoretic formulation, called distributed attribute-based private access control (DAPAC). With $N$ non-colluding authorities (servers), $N$ attributes and $K$ possible values for each attribute, the DAPAC system lets each server learn only the single attribute value that it verifies, and is oblivious to the remaining $N-1$. The user retrieves its designated record, without learning anything about the remaining database records. The goal is to maximize the rate, i.e., the ratio of desired message size to total download size. However, not all attributes are sensitive, and DAPAC's privacy constraints can be too restrictive, negatively affecting the rate. To leverage the heterogeneous privacy requirements of user attributes, we propose heterogeneous (Het)DAPAC, a framework which off-loads verification of $N-D$ of the $N$ attributes to a central server, and retains DAPAC's architecture for the $D$ sensitive attributes. We first present a HetDAPAC scheme, which improves the rate from $\frac{1}{2K}$ to $\frac{1}{K+1}$, while sacrificing the privacy of a few non-sensitive attributes. Unlike DAPAC, our scheme entails a download imbalance across servers; we propose a second scheme achieving a balanced per-server download and a rate of $\frac{D+1}{2KD}$.
