However, such numerical simulations are computationally expensive, limiting the real-world practical application of the framework. To address this issue, previous studies have used machine learning to predict the structural responses to ground motions with low computational costs. These studies typically conduct NLTHAs for a few hundreds ground motions and use the results to train and validate surrogate models. However, most of the previous studies focused on computationally-inexpensive response analysis models such as single degree of freedom. Surrogate models of high-fidelity response analysis are required to enrich the quantity and diversity of information used for damage assessment in PBEE. Notably, the computational cost of creating training and validation datasets increases if the fidelity of response analysis model becomes higher. Therefore, methods that enable surrogate modeling of high-fidelity response analysis without a large number of training samples are needed. This study proposes a framework that uses transfer learning to construct the surrogate model of a high-fidelity response analysis model. This framework uses a surrogate model of low-fidelity response analysis as the pretrained model and transfers its knowledge to construct surrogate models for high-fidelity response analysis with substantially reduced computational cost. As a case study, surrogate models that predict responses of a 20-story steel moment frame were constructed with only 20 samples as the training dataset. The responses to the ground motions predicted by constructed surrogate model were consistent with a site-specific time-based hazard.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u7ed3\u6784\u54cd\u5e94\u5206\u6790\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5730\u9707\u5de5\u7a0b\u6846\u67b6\u9700\u8981\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u7a0b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4e\u4fdd\u771f\u7b80\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5206\u6790\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u4f4e\u4fdd\u771f\u54cd\u5e94\u5206\u6790\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u5c06\u5176\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u54cd\u5e94\u5206\u6790\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u4e2d", "result": "\u4ee520\u5c42\u94a2\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff0c\u4ec5\u970020\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u5373\u53ef\u6784\u5efa\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u7279\u5b9a\u573a\u5730\u65f6\u7a0b\u707e\u5bb3\u4e00\u81f4", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u7acb\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u54cd\u5e94\u5206\u6790\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u57fa\u4e8e\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5730\u9707\u5de5\u7a0b\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528"}}

Through 26 semi-structured interviews with practitioners from different application domains and with varied backgrounds across 23 countries, we conducted research on fairness requirements in AI from software engineering perspective. Our study assesses the participants' awareness of fairness in AI / ML software and its application within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), from translating fairness concerns into requirements to assessing their arising early in the SDLC. It also examines fairness through the key assessment dimensions of implementation, validation, evaluation, and how it is balanced with trade-offs involving other priorities, such as addressing all the software functionalities and meeting critical delivery deadlines. Findings of our thematic qualitative analysis show that while our participants recognize the aforementioned AI fairness dimensions, practices are inconsistent, and fairness is often deprioritized with noticeable knowledge gaps.

Most existing jailbreak methods revolve around Prompt Engineering or adversarial optimization, yet we identify a previously overlooked phenomenon: many harmful scenarios are highly consistent with legitimate ones in terms of underlying principles. Based on this finding, this paper proposes the Safe2Harm Semantic Isomorphism Attack method, which achieves efficient jailbreaking through four stages: first, rewrite the harmful question into a semantically safe question with similar underlying principles; second, extract the thematic mapping relationship between the two; third, let the LLM generate a detailed response targeting the safe question; finally, reversely rewrite the safe response based on the thematic mapping relationship to obtain harmful output. Experiments on 7 mainstream LLMs and three types of benchmark datasets show that Safe2Harm exhibits strong jailbreaking capability, and its overall performance is superior to existing methods.

Here, we develop a data-physics hybrid generative framework that reconstructs an individual stroke survivor's neuromuscular control from a single 20 m level-ground walking trial and predicts task-conditioned locomotion across rehabilitation scenarios. The system combines wearable-sensor kinematics, a proportional-derivative physics controller, a population Healthy Motion Atlas, and goal-conditioned deep reinforcement learning with behaviour cloning and generative adversarial imitation learning to generate physically plausible, patient-specific gait simulations for slopes and stairs. In 11 stroke survivors, the personalized controllers preserved idiosyncratic gait patterns while improving joint-angle and endpoint fidelity by 4.73% and 12.10%, respectively, and reducing training time to 25.56% relative to a physics-only baseline. In a multicentre pilot involving 21 inpatients, clinicians who used our locomotion predictions to guide task selection and difficulty obtained larger gains in Fugl-Meyer lower-extremity scores over 28 days of standard rehabilitation than control clinicians (mean change 6.0 versus 3.7 points). These findings indicate that our generative, task-predictive framework can augment clinical decision-making in post-stroke gait rehabilitation and provide a template for dynamically personalized motor recovery strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6570\u636e-\u7269\u7406\u6df7\u5408\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u6b2120\u7c73\u5e73\u5730\u884c\u8d70\u6570\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u98ce\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u659c\u5761/\u697c\u68af\u884c\u8d70\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5eb7\u590d\u6548\u679c", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4e2d\u98ce\u5eb7\u590d\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ea\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u9759\u6001\u635f\u4f24\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9884\u6d4b\u60a3\u8005\u6267\u884c\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u659c\u5761\u884c\u8d70\u3001\u722c\u697c\u68af\uff09\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5eb7\u590d\u9700\u6c42", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u3001\u6bd4\u4f8b-\u5fae\u5206\u7269\u7406\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u3001\u5065\u5eb7\u4eba\u7fa4\u8fd0\u52a8\u56fe\u8c31\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u6761\u4ef6\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686/\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7b26\u5408\u7269\u7406\u89c4\u5f8b\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6b65\u6001\u6a21\u62df", "result": "\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u4e2a\u4f53\u6b65\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5c06\u5173\u8282\u89d2\u5ea6\u548c\u7aef\u70b9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u9ad84.73%\u548c12.10%\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u81f3\u7eaf\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u768425.56%\uff1b\u591a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8bd5\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6cbb\u7597\u5e08\u7ec4\u60a3\u8005Fugl-Meyer\u8bc4\u5206\u6539\u5584\u66f4\u663e\u8457\uff086.0\u5206 vs 3.7\u5206\uff09", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4efb\u52a1\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u589e\u5f3a\u4e2d\u98ce\u540e\u6b65\u6001\u5eb7\u590d\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8fd0\u52a8\u529f\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u6a21\u677f"}}

However, the effectiveness of tool use depends heavily on the quality of the associated documentation and knowledge base context. These materials are usually written for human users and are often misaligned with how LLMs interpret information. This problem is even more pronounced in industrial settings, where hundreds of tools with overlapping functionality create challenges in scalability, variability, and ambiguity. We propose Verification-Guided Context Optimization (VGCO), a framework that uses LLMs as editors to automatically refine tool-related documentation and knowledge base context. VGCO works in two stages. First, Evaluation collects real-world failure cases and identifies mismatches between tools and their context. Second, Optimization performs hierarchical editing through offline learning with structure-aware, in-context optimization. The novelty of our LLM editors has three main aspects. First, they use a hierarchical structure that naturally integrates into the tool-calling workflow. Second, they are state-aware, action-specific, and verification-guided, which constrains the search space and enables efficient, targeted improvements. Third, they enable cost-efficient sub-task specialization, either by prompt engineering large editor models or by post-training smaller editor models. Unlike prior work that emphasizes multi-turn reasoning, VGCO focuses on the single-turn, large-scale tool-calling problem and achieves significant improvements in accuracy, robustness, and generalization across LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "VGCO\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7f16\u8f91\u5668\u81ea\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u6587\u6863\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u89e3\u51b3\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u7684\u6548\u679c\u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u6587\u6863\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6750\u6599\u4e3a\u4eba\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e0eLLM\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5de5\u5177\u529f\u80fd\u91cd\u53e0\u5bfc\u81f4\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "VGCO\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u8bc4\u4f30\u9636\u6bb5\uff08\u6536\u96c6\u5931\u8d25\u6848\u4f8b\u3001\u8bc6\u522b\u5de5\u5177\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff09\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u9636\u6bb5\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u5c42\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f18\u5316\uff09\u3002LLM\u7f16\u8f91\u5668\u5177\u6709\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u72b6\u6001\u611f\u77e5/\u52a8\u4f5c\u7279\u5b9a/\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5f15\u5bfc\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u3002", "result": "VGCO\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u5355\u8f6e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2aLLM\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u7684\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "VGCO\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u76f8\u5173\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6587\u6863\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5de5\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Accurate identification of the types of IoT devices and their associated actions through network traffic analysis is essential to mitigate potential threats. By monitoring and analysing packet flows between IoT devices and connected networks, anomalous or malicious behaviours can be detected. Existing research focuses primarily on device identification within local networks using methods such as protocol fingerprinting and wireless frequency scanning. However, these approaches are limited in their ability to monitor or classify IoT devices externally. To address this gap, we investigate the use of machine learning (ML) techniques, specifically Random Forest (RF), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), in conjunction with targeted network traffic monitoring to classify IoT device types and their actions. We constructed a testbed comprising an NPAT-enabled router and a diverse set of IoT devices, including smart cameras, controller hubs, home appliances, power controllers, and streaming devices.

However, conventional construction methods demand extensive location-labeled data, which are costly and impractical in many real-world scenarios. This paper presents a blind radio map construction framework that infers user trajectories from indoor multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) channel measurements without relying on location labels. It first proves that channel state information (CSI) under non-line-of-sight (NLOS) exhibits spatial continuity under a quasi-specular environmental model, allowing the derivation of a CSI-distance metric that is proportional to the corresponding physical distance. For rectilinear trajectories in Poisson-distributed access point (AP) deployments, it is shown that the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) of localization error vanishes asymptotically, even under poor angular resolution. Building on these theoretical results, a spatially regularized Bayesian inference framework is developed that jointly estimates channel features, distinguishes line-of-sight (LOS)/NLOS conditions and recovers user trajectories. Experiments on a ray-tracing dataset demonstrate an average localization error of 0.68 m and a beam map reconstruction error of 3.3%, validating the effectiveness of the proposed blind mapping method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u76f2\u5c04\u9891\u5730\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528MIMO-OFDM\u4fe1\u9053\u6d4b\u91cf\u63a8\u65ad\u7528\u6237\u8f68\u8ff9", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5c04\u9891\u5730\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u4e14\u4e0d\u5b9e\u7528", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a7a\u95f4\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f30\u8ba1\u4fe1\u9053\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u533a\u5206LOS/NLOS\u6761\u4ef6\u5e76\u6062\u590d\u7528\u6237\u8f68\u8ff9", "result": "\u5728\u5c04\u7ebf\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5e73\u5747\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a0.68\u7c73\uff0c\u6ce2\u675f\u56fe\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a3.3%", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u76f2\u5c04\u9891\u5730\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u65e0\u7ebf\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

Recent studies demonstrate an average 39% performance drop when instructions are delivered across multiple turns, with models making premature assumptions and failing to course correct (Laban et al., 2025). This degradation is particularly problematic in exploratory programming tasks where developers need to investigate alternative approaches without committing to a single path. Current solutions force users into a false dichotomy: continue in a context-polluted conversation where the LLM becomes increasingly confused, or start fresh and lose all accumulated context.\n  We present ContextBranch, a conversation management system that applies version control semantics to LLM interactions. ContextBranch provides four core primitives--checkpoint, branch, switch, and inject--enabling users to capture conversation state, explore alternatives in isolation, and selectively merge insights. We evaluate ContextBranch through a controlled experiment with 30 software engineering scenarios featuring intentionally polluting explorations. Branched conversations achieved higher response quality compared to linear conversations, with large improvements in focus and context awareness. Benefits were concentrated in complex scenarios involving conceptually distant explorations. Branching reduced context size by 58.1% (31.0 to 13.0 messages), eliminating irrelevant exploratory content. Our work establishes conversation branching as a fundamental primitive for AI-assisted exploratory work, demonstrating that isolation prevents context pollution when exploring alternatives.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This paper presents Adjudicator, a system that addresses the critical data mining challenge of automatically identifying and correcting label noise and has been validated for production deployment. Adjudicator models this as a neuro-symbolic task, first constructing a dynamic Knowledge Graph (KG) to unify item context. This KG then informs a \"Council of Agents,\" a novel multi-agent Large Language Model architecture where specialized agents debate and vote on a label's validity. We validate our system on a 1,000-item balanced subset of the AlleNoise benchmark. Our KG-informed model achieves a 0.99 F1-score, significantly outperforming a single-LLM baseline (0.48 F1) and a non-KG council (0.59 F1). Our analysis reveals this is due to a Precision, achieved by a novel override logic that uses the KG to perfectly identify complex, structural errors (complete Recall) -- a class of errors that baselines fail to find.

While this transformation improves performance, it significantly impacts static features such as machine instructions and control flow graphs, which are crucial to binary analysis. Yet, despite its broad impact, the security impact of function inlining remains underexplored to date. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of function inlining through the lens of machine learning-based binary analysis. To this end, we dissect the inlining decision pipeline within the LLVM's cost model and explore the combinations of the compiler options that aggressively promote the function inlining ratio beyond standard optimization levels, which we term extreme inlining. We focus on five ML-assisted binary analysis tasks for security, using 20 unique models to systematically evaluate their robustness under extreme inlining scenarios. Our extensive experiments reveal several significant findings: i) function inlining, though a benign transformation in intent, can (in)directly affect ML model behaviors, being potentially exploited by evading discriminative or generative ML models; ii) ML models relying on static features can be highly sensitive to inlining; iii) subtle compiler settings can be leveraged to deliberately craft evasive binary variants; and iv) inlining ratios vary substantially across applications and build configurations, undermining assumptions of consistency in training and evaluation of ML models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5168\u9762\u7814\u7a76\u51fd\u6570\u5185\u8054\uff08function inlining\uff09\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u5206\u6790\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6781\u7aef\u5185\u8054\uff08extreme inlining\uff09\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e00\u770b\u4f3c\u826f\u6027\u7684\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u4f18\u5316\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u5229\u7528\u6765\u89c4\u907fML\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u51fd\u6570\u5185\u8054\u4f18\u5316\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7528\u4e8e\u73b0\u4ee3\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u9759\u6001\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u673a\u5668\u6307\u4ee4\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u6d41\u56fe\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u5206\u6790\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u51fd\u6570\u5185\u8054\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5f71\u54cd\u81f3\u4eca\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u56e2\u961f\u5256\u6790\u4e86LLVM\u6210\u672c\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u8054\u51b3\u7b56\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u8d85\u8d8a\u6807\u51c6\u4f18\u5316\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u9009\u9879\u7ec4\u5408\uff08\u79f0\u4e3a\u6781\u7aef\u5185lining\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u57285\u4e2aML\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f7f\u752820\u4e2a\u72ec\u7279\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u5185lining\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1ai) \u51fd\u6570\u5185\u8054\u53ef\u80fd\uff08\u76f4\u63a5\u6216\u95f4\u63a5\uff09\u5f71\u54cdML\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u5229\u7528\u6765\u89c4\u907f\u5224\u522b\u5f0f\u6216\u751f\u6210\u5f0fML\u6a21\u578b\uff1bii) \u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u7684ML\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5185\u8054\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\uff1biii) \u7ec6\u5fae\u7684\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u8bbe\u7f6e\u53ef\u88ab\u7528\u6765\u523b\u610f\u6784\u9020\u89c4\u907f\u6027\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u53d8\u4f53\uff1biv) \u5185\u8054\u6bd4\u7387\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u6784\u5efa\u914d\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5dee\u5f02\u5f88\u5927\uff0c\u7834\u574f\u4e86ML\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u51fd\u6570\u5185\u8054\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8eML\u7684\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u5206\u6790\u5b89\u5168\u6784\u6210\u6f5c\u5728\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684ML\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u5b89\u5168\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce PerfCoder, a family of LLMs specifically designed to generate performance-enhanced code from source code via interpretable, customized optimizations. PerfCoder is fine-tuned on a curated collection of real-world optimization trajectories with human-readable annotations, and preference-aligned by reinforcement fine-tuning using runtime measurements, enabling it to propose input-specific improvement strategies and apply them directly without relying on iterative refinement. On the PIE code performance benchmark, PerfCoder surpasses all existing models in both runtime speedup and effective optimization rate, demonstrating that performance optimization cannot be achieved by scale alone but requires optimization stratetgy awareness. In addition, PerfCoder can generate interpretable feedback about the source code, which, when provided as input to a larger LLM in a planner-and-optimizer cooperative workflow, can further improve outcomes.

Although recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising opportunities for automation, existing applications rely on simplistic prompting without task decomposition or domain adaptation, resulting in unreliable black-box behavior and limited insight into model capabilities across penetration testing stages. To address this gap, we introduce PentestEval, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs across six decomposed penetration testing stages: Information Collection, Weakness Gathering and Filtering, Attack Decision-Making, Exploit Generation and Revision. PentestEval integrates expert-annotated ground truth with a fully automated evaluation pipeline across 346 tasks covering all stages in 12 realistic vulnerable scenarios. Our stage-level evaluation of 9 widely used LLMs reveals generally weak performance and distinct limitations across the stages of penetration-testing workflow. End-to-end pipelines reach only 31% success rate, and existing LLM-powered systems such as PentestGPT, PentestAgent, and VulnBot exhibit similar limitations, with autonomous agents failing almost entirely. These findings highlight that autonomous penetration testing demands stronger structured reasoning, where modularization enhances each individual stage and improves overall performance. PentestEval provides the foundational benchmark needed for future research on fine-grained, stage-level evaluation, paving the way toward more reliable LLM-based automation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture, with its RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) modules, has emerged as a pivotal solution for dynamic resource management and network slicing.

This paper proposes an adaptive Meta Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (Meta-HRL) framework, inspired by Model Agnostic Meta Learning (MAML), to jointly optimize resource allocation and network slicing in O-RAN. The framework integrates hierarchical control with meta learning to enable both global and local adaptation: the high-level controller allocates resources across slices, while low level agents perform intra slice scheduling. The adaptive meta-update mechanism weights tasks by temporal difference error variance, improving stability and prioritizing complex network scenarios. Theoretical analysis establishes sublinear convergence and regret guarantees for the two-level learning process. Simulation results demonstrate a 19.8% improvement in network management efficiency compared with baseline RL and meta-RL approaches, along with faster adaptation and higher QoS satisfaction across eMBB, URLLC, and mMTC slices. Additional ablation and scalability studies confirm the method's robustness, achieving up to 40% faster adaptation and consistent fairness, latency, and throughput performance as network scale increases.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To support companies in their transition towards DevOps, this paper presents an adaptation of DevOps according to security regulations and standards. We report on our longitudinal study at Siemens AG, consisting of several individual sub-studies in the inception, validation, and initial adoption of our framework based on RefA as well as the implications for practice. RefA is a prescriptive model of a security compliant DevOps lifecycle based on the IEC 62443-4-1 standard. The overall framework is aimed at professionals, not only security experts, being able to use it on implementing DevOps processes while remaining compliant with security norms. We demonstrate how RefA facilitates the transfer of security compliance knowledge to product development teams.

Property-based testing addresses this shortcoming by generating multiple inputs satisfying properties but requires significant manual effort to define properties and their constraints. We propose a semantics-based approach that automatically transforms unit tests into property-based tests by extracting specifications from implementations via single-path symbolic analysis. We demonstrate this approach through Teralizer, a prototype for Java that transforms JUnit tests into property-based jqwik tests. Unlike prior work that generalizes from input-output examples, Teralizer derives specifications from program semantics.\n  We evaluated Teralizer on three progressively challenging datasets. On EvoSuite-generated tests for EqBench and Apache Commons utilities, Teralizer improved mutation scores by 1-4 percentage points. Generalization of mature developer-written tests from Apache Commons utilities showed only 0.05-0.07 percentage points improvement. Analysis of 632 real-world Java projects from RepoReapers highlights applicability barriers: only 1.7% of projects completed the generalization pipeline, with failures primarily due to type support limitations in symbolic analysis and static analysis limitations in our prototype. Based on the results, we provide a roadmap for future work, identifying research and engineering challenges that need to be tackled to advance the field of test generalization.\n  Artifacts available at: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17950381", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

As deployment shifts toward edge and resource constrained environments, quantized models such as INT8 and NF4 are becoming standard. Yet the impact of precision reduction on formal causal reasoning is poorly understood. To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically evaluate quantization effects across all three levels of Pearls Causal Ladder. Using a 3000 sample stratified CLadder benchmark, we find that rung level accuracy in Llama 3 8B remains broadly stable under quantization, with NF4 showing less than one percent overall degradation. Interventional queries at rung 2 are the most sensitive to precision loss, whereas counterfactual reasoning at rung 3 is comparatively stable but exhibits heterogeneous weaknesses across query types such as collider bias and backdoor adjustment. Experiments on the CRASS benchmark show near identical performance across precisions, indicating that existing commonsense counterfactual datasets lack the structural sensitivity needed to reveal quantization induced reasoning drift. We further evaluate Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation using ground truth causal graphs and observe a consistent improvement in NF4 interventional accuracy of plus 1.7 percent, partially offsetting compression related degradation. These results suggest that causal reasoning is unexpectedly robust to four bit quantization, graph structured augmentation can selectively reinforce interventional reasoning, and current counterfactual benchmarks fail to capture deeper causal brittleness.

We present a qualitative case-study methodology for auditing policy-linked behavioral selectivity in long-horizon interaction. In a single 86-turn dialogue session, the same model shows Normal Performance (NP) in broad, non-sensitive domains while repeatedly producing Functional Refusal (FR) in provider- or policy-sensitive domains, yielding a consistent asymmetry between NP and FR across domains. Drawing on learned helplessness as an analogy, we introduce learned incapacity (LI) as a behavioral descriptor for this selective withholding without implying intentionality or internal mechanisms. We operationalize three response regimes (NP, FR, Meta-Narrative; MN) and show that MN role-framing narratives tend to co-occur with refusals in the same sensitive contexts.

As these systems scale, sustainability concerns have intensified, with most assessments focusing on model architecture, hardware efficiency, and deployment infrastructure. However, existing mitigation efforts largely overlook how user interaction practices themselves shape the energy profile of LLM based systems. In this vision paper, we argue that interaction level behavior appears to be an underexamined factor shaping the environmental impact of LLM based systems, and we present this issue across four dimensions. First, extended conversational patterns increase token production and raise the computational cost of inference. Second, expectations of instant responses limit opportunities for energy aware scheduling and workload consolidation. Third, everyday user habits contribute to cumulative operational demand in ways that are rarely quantified. Fourth, the accumulation of context affects memory requirements and reduces the efficiency of long running dialogues. Addressing these challenges requires rethinking how chatbot interactions are designed and conceptualized, and adopting perspectives that recognize sustainability as partly dependent on the conversational norms through which users engage with LLM based systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8ba4\u4e3a\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u884c\u4e3a\u662f\u5f71\u54cdLLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u73af\u5883\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4f46\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u56db\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u5206\u6790\u5e76\u547c\u5401\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ea4\u4e92\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u5b9e\u8df5\u5bf9LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u8017\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u613f\u666f\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ece\u56db\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u80fd\u8017\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1a\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u54cd\u5e94\u671f\u671b\u3001\u7528\u6237\u4e60\u60ef\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u79ef\u7d2f\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5ef6\u957f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u3001\u5373\u65f6\u54cd\u5e94\u671f\u671b\u3001\u7528\u6237\u4e60\u60ef\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u79ef\u7d2f\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4ea4\u4e92\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u8003\u91cf\u878d\u5165\u5bf9\u8bdd\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4eLLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

The platform independence offered through Wasm makes it an attractive solution for many different applications that can run on disparate infrastructures. In addition, Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) are offered in many computing infrastructures, which allows also running security sensitive Wasm workloads independent of the specific platforms offered. However, recent work has shown that Wasm binaries are more sensitive to code confidentiality attacks than native binaries. The previous result was obtained for Intel SGX only. In this paper, we take this one step further, introducing a new Wasm code-confidentiality attack that exploits exposed address-space information in TEEs. Our attack enables the extraction of crucial execution features which, when combined with additional side channels, allows us to with high reliability obtain more than 70% of the code in most cases.

We introduce the Semantic Grounding Index (SGI), defined as the ratio of angular distances from the response to the question versus the context on the unit hypersphere $\\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$.Our central finding is \\emph{semantic laziness}: hallucinated responses remain angularly proximate to questions rather than departing toward retrieved contexts. On HaluEval ($n$=5,000), we observe large effect sizes (Cohen's $d$ ranging from 0.92 to 1.28) across five embedding models with mean cross-model correlation $r$=0.85. Crucially, we derive from the spherical triangle inequality that SGI's discriminative power should increase with question-context angular separation $\u03b8(q,c)$-a theoretical prediction confirmed empirically: effect size rises monotonically from $d$=0.61 -low $\u03b8(q,c)$, to $d$=1.27 -high $\u03b8(q,c)$, with AUC improving from 0.72 to 0.83. Subgroup analysis reveals that SGI excels on long responses ($d$=2.05) and short questions ($d$=1.22), while remaining robust across context lengths.

To enhance video recognition development, many institutions have released high-quality public datasets with open-source licenses for training advanced models. At the same time, these datasets are also susceptible to misuse and infringement. Dataset copyright auditing is an effective solution to identify such unauthorized use. However, existing dataset copyright solutions primarily focus on the image domain; the complex nature of video data leaves dataset copyright auditing in the video domain unexplored. Specifically, video data introduces an additional temporal dimension, which poses significant challenges to the effectiveness and stealthiness of existing methods.\n  In this paper, we propose VICTOR, the first dataset copyright auditing approach for video recognition systems. We develop a general and stealthy sample modification strategy that enhances the output discrepancy of the target model. By modifying only a small proportion of samples (e.g., 1%), VICTOR amplifies the impact of published modified samples on the prediction behavior of the target models. Then, the difference in the model's behavior for published modified and unpublished original samples can serve as a key basis for dataset auditing. Extensive experiments on multiple models and datasets highlight the superiority of VICTOR.

Estimating causal effects, particularly the average treatment effect (ATE), from observational data has garnered significant attention. However, computing the ATE from real-world observational data poses substantial privacy risks to users. Differential privacy, which offers strict theoretical guarantees, has emerged as a standard approach for privacy-preserving data analysis. However, existing differentially private ATE estimation works rely on specific assumptions, provide limited privacy protection, or fail to offer comprehensive information protection.\n  To this end, we introduce PrivATE, a practical ATE estimation framework that ensures differential privacy. In fact, various scenarios require varying levels of privacy protection. For example, only test scores are generally sensitive information in education evaluation, while all types of medical record data are usually private. To accommodate different privacy requirements, we design two levels (i.e., label-level and sample-level) of privacy protection in PrivATE. By deriving an adaptive matching limit, PrivATE effectively balances noise-induced error and matching error, leading to a more accurate estimate of ATE.

Georgiev, G${\u00f3}$mez-Serrano, Tao, and Wagner [GGSTW+25] demonstrate that AI systems can explore new constructions and improve existing bounds, illustrating the growing potential of LLMs to accelerate mathematical discovery. Similarly, Bubeck et al. [BCE+25] show that GPT-5 can meaningfully contribute to scientific workflows, from proposing hypotheses to generating proofs and analyses. Despite these advances, a rigorous evaluation of these models on canonical, graduate-level mathematical theory remains necessary to understand their baseline reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we present a comprehensive benchmark of four frontier models: GPT-5-Thinking, Gemini-3-Pro, Claude-Sonnet-4.5-Thinking, and Grok-4 against the classic curriculum of Randomized Algorithms by Motwani and Raghavan [MR95].\n  We tasked each model with generating formal LaTeX proofs for a series of lemmas and exercises spanning the textbook. We find that while the top-tier models (Gemini, and Claude) achieve a high accuracy rate (approx. 66%), demonstrating a robust grasp of probabilistic method and formal logic, other models lag significantly in consistency (approx. 40%).

One notable threat is the Membership Inference Attack (MIA), where adversaries infer whether a specific sample was used in model training. However, the true impact of MIA on LLMs remains unclear due to inconsistent findings and the lack of standardized evaluation methods, further complicated by the undisclosed nature of many LLM training sets. To address these limitations, we propose PerProb, a unified, label-free framework for indirectly assessing LLM memorization vulnerabilities. PerProb evaluates changes in perplexity and average log probability between data generated by victim and adversary models, enabling an indirect estimation of training-induced memory. Compared with prior MIA methods that rely on member/non-member labels or internal access, PerProb is independent of model and task, and applicable in both black-box and white-box settings. Through a systematic classification of MIA into four attack patterns, we evaluate PerProb's effectiveness across five datasets, revealing varying memory behaviors and privacy risks among LLMs. Additionally, we assess mitigation strategies, including knowledge distillation, early stopping, and differential privacy, demonstrating their effectiveness in reducing data leakage.

However, the standard Top-k routing strategy imposes a uniform sparsity pattern that ignores the varying difficulty of tokens. While Top-p routing offers a flexible alternative, existing implementations typically rely on a fixed global probability threshold, which results in uncontrolled computational costs and sensitivity to hyperparameter selection. In this paper, we propose DTop-p MoE, a sparsity-controllable dynamic Top-p routing mechanism. To resolve the challenge of optimizing a non-differentiable threshold, we utilize a Proportional-Integral (PI) Controller that dynamically adjusts the probability threshold to align the running activated-expert sparsity with a specified target. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic routing normalization mechanism that adapts layer-wise routing logits, allowing different layers to learn distinct expert-selection patterns while utilizing a global probability threshold. Extensive experiments on Large Language Models and Diffusion Transformers demonstrate that DTop-p consistently outperforms both Top-k and fixed-threshold Top-p baselines. Our analysis confirms that DTop-p maintains precise control over the number of activated experts while adaptively allocating resources across different tokens and layers. Furthermore, DTop-p exhibits strong scaling properties with respect to expert granularity, expert capacity, model size, and dataset size, offering a robust framework for large-scale MoE pre-training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DTop-p MoE\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001Top-p\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7PI\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6982\u7387\u9608\u503c\u6765\u63a7\u5236\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540ctoken\u7684\u96be\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u7684Top-k\u8def\u7531\u5bf9\u6240\u6709token\u65bd\u52a0\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86token\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u6027\u3002\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684Top-p\u8def\u7531\u4f7f\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6982\u7387\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4e0d\u53ef\u63a7\u4e14\u5bf9\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u654f\u611f\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6bd4\u4f8b\u79ef\u5206(PI)\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6982\u7387\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u4f7f\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6307\u5b9a\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u7531\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u9009\u62e9\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDTop-p consistently\u4f18\u4e8eTop-k\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u9608\u503cTop-p\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u80fd\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e13\u5bb6\u6570\u91cf\u5e76\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u914d\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "conclusion": "DTop-p MoE\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002"}}

Existing chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting methods enhance model reasoning by eliciting intermediate steps, but suffer from two major limitations: First, their uniform application tends to induce overthinking on simple tasks. Second, they lack intention abstraction in code generation, such as explicitly modeling core algorithmic design and efficiency, leading models to focus on surface-level structures while neglecting the global problem objective. Inspired by the cognitive economy principle of engaging structured reasoning only when necessary to conserve cognitive resources, we propose RoutingGen, a novel difficulty-aware routing framework that dynamically adapts prompting strategies for code generation. For simple tasks, it adopts few-shot prompting; for more complex ones, it invokes a structured reasoning strategy, termed Intention Chain-of-Thought (ICoT), which we introduce to guide the model in capturing task intention, such as the core algorithmic logic and its time complexity.

However, a critical dichotomy persists: while models are rigorously benchmarked, the data fueling them remains a black box--characterized by opaque composition, uncertain provenance, and a lack of systematic evaluation. This opacity hinders reproducibility and obscures the causal link between data characteristics and model behaviors. To bridge this gap, we introduce OpenDataArena (ODA), a holistic and open platform designed to benchmark the intrinsic value of post-training data. ODA establishes a comprehensive ecosystem comprising four key pillars: (i) a unified training-evaluation pipeline that ensures fair, open comparisons across diverse models (e.g., Llama, Qwen) and domains; (ii) a multi-dimensional scoring framework that profiles data quality along tens of distinct axes; (iii) an interactive data lineage explorer to visualize dataset genealogy and dissect component sources; and (iv) a fully open-source toolkit for training, evaluation, and scoring to foster data research. Extensive experiments on ODA--covering over 120 training datasets across multiple domains on 22 benchmarks, validated by more than 600 training runs and 40 million processed data points--reveal non-trivial insights. Our analysis uncovers the inherent trade-offs between data complexity and task performance, identifies redundancy in popular benchmarks through lineage tracing, and maps the genealogical relationships across datasets. We release all results, tools, and configurations to democratize access to high-quality data evaluation. Rather than merely expanding a leaderboard, ODA envisions a shift from trial-and-error data curation to a principled science of Data-Centric AI, paving the way for rigorous studies on data mixing laws and the strategic composition of foundation models.", "AI": {"tldr": "OpenDataArena\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ba1\u9053\u3001\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\u3001\u6570\u636e\u8c31\u7cfb\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u548c\u5f00\u6e90\u5de5\u5177\u5305\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9ed1\u7bb1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3AI\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u5173\u952e\u5206\u6b67\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u7ecf\u8fc7\u4e25\u683c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u800c\u6570\u636e\u672c\u8eab\u5374\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ed1\u7bb1\u2014\u2014\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u7684\u7ec4\u6210\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u7684\u6765\u6e90\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u6027\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6a21\u7cca\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "OpenDataArena\uff08ODA\uff09\u5e73\u53f0\u5305\u542b\u56db\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff1a\uff08i\uff09\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3-\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982Llama\u3001Qwen\uff09\u548c\u9886\u57df\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u5f00\u653e\u6bd4\u8f83\uff1b\uff08ii\uff09\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u6570\u5341\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b\uff08iii\uff09\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u8c31\u7cfb\u63a2\u7d22\u5668\uff0c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8c31\u7cfb\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6765\u6e90\uff1b\uff08iv\uff09\u5b8c\u5168\u5f00\u6e90\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u8bc4\u5206\u5de5\u5177\u5305\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8986\u76d6120\u591a\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u300122\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7600\u591a\u6b21\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fd0\u884c\u548c4000\u4e07\u5904\u7406\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5728ODA\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff1a\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5185\u5728\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c31\u7cfb\u8ffd\u8e2a\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u6d41\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u4e2d\u7684\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed8\u5236\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u95f4\u7684\u8c31\u7cfb\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u6240\u6709\u7ed3\u679c\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u914d\u7f6e\u90fd\u5df2\u53d1\u5e03\uff0c\u4ee5\u6c11\u4e3b\u5316\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u8bbf\u95ee\u3002", "conclusion": "ODA\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u7acb\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u6d41\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u4e2d\u7684\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed8\u5236\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u95f4\u7684\u8c31\u7cfb\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u8be5\u5e73\u53f0\u65e8\u5728\u63a8\u52a8\u4ece\u8bd5\u9519\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u5411\u6570\u636e\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3AI\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027\u79d1\u5b66\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u6df7\u5408\u89c4\u5f8b\u548c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u6218\u7565\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u7814\u7a76\u94fa\u5e73\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

However, they still struggle with complex tasks that necessitate dynamic and iterative focusing on fine-grained visual regions to achieve precise grounding and diagnosis. We introduce Ophiuchus, a versatile, tool-augmented framework that equips an MLLM to (i) decide when additional visual evidence is needed, (ii) determine where to probe and ground within the medical image, and (iii) seamlessly weave the relevant sub-image content back into an interleaved, multimodal chain of thought. In contrast to prior approaches limited by the performance ceiling of specialized tools, Ophiuchus integrates the model's inherent grounding and perception capabilities with external tools, thereby fostering higher-level reasoning. The core of our method is a three-stage training strategy: cold-start training with tool-integrated reasoning data to achieve basic tool selection and adaptation for inspecting key regions; self-reflection fine-tuning to strengthen reflective reasoning and encourage revisiting tool outputs; and Agentic Tool Reinforcement Learning to directly optimize task-specific rewards and emulate expert-like diagnostic behavior. Extensive experiments show that Ophiuchus consistently outperforms both closed-source and open-source SOTA methods across diverse medical benchmarks, including VQA, detection, and reasoning-based segmentation. Our approach illuminates a path toward medical AI agents that can genuinely \"think with images\" through tool-integrated reasoning.

However, many location descriptions specify positions relatively with spatial relationships, making geocoding based solely on place names or geo-indicative words inaccurate. This issue frequently arises in biological specimen collection records, where locations are often described through narratives rather than coordinates if they pre-date GPS. Accurate georeferencing is vital for biodiversity studies, yet the process remains labour-intensive, leading to a demand for automated georeferencing solutions. This paper explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to georeference complex locality descriptions automatically, focusing on the biodiversity collections domain. We first identified effective prompting patterns, then fine-tuned an LLM using Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) on biodiversity datasets from multiple regions and languages. Our approach outperforms existing baselines with an average, across datasets, of 65% of records within a 10 km radius, for a fixed amount of training data.

Currently, performing large-scale edits on LLMs while ensuring the Reliability, Generality, and Locality metrics of the edits remain a challenge. This paper proposes a Massive editing approach for LLMs based on dynamic weight Generation (MeG). Our MeG involves attaching a dynamic weight neuron to specific layers of the LLMs and using a diffusion model to conditionally generate the weights of this neuron based on the input query required for the knowledge. This allows the use of adding a single dynamic weight neuron to achieve the goal of large-scale knowledge editing. Experiments show that our MeG can significantly improve the performance of large-scale KE in terms of Reliability, Generality, and Locality metrics compared to existing knowledge editing methods, particularly with a high percentage point increase in the absolute value index for the Locality metric, demonstrating the advantages of our proposed method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u6743\u91cd\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21LLMs\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5MeG\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u5c42\u6dfb\u52a0\u52a8\u6001\u6743\u91cd\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5728LLMs\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7f16\u8f91\u65f6\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u6307\u6807\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848", "method": "MeG\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728LLMs\u7279\u5b9a\u5c42\u9644\u52a0\u52a8\u6001\u6743\u91cd\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6839\u636e\u4e0d\u540c\u67e5\u8be2\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u6dfb\u52a0\u5355\u4e2a\u52a8\u6001\u6743\u91cd\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eMeG\u5728\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u9ad8\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u503c\u63d0\u5347", "conclusion": "MeG\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\ufffd\ufffd\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u6743\u91cd\u751f\u6210\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u52bf"}}

However, their widespread commercialization is hindered due to their low transferability across diverse terminals. This transferability challenge stems from three limitations: high reliance on port operational specialists, a high demand for terminal-specific data, and time-consuming manual deployment processes. Leveraging the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), this paper proposes PortAgent, an LLM-driven vehicle dispatching agent that fully automates the VDS transferring workflow. It bears three features: (1) no need for port operations specialists; (2) low need of data; and (3) fast deployment. Specifically, specialist dependency is eliminated by the Virtual Expert Team (VET). The VET collaborates with four virtual experts, including a Knowledge Retriever, Modeler, Coder, and Debugger, to emulate a human expert team for the VDS transferring workflow. These experts specialize in the domain of terminal VDS via a few-shot example learning approach. Through this approach, the experts are able to learn VDS-domain knowledge from a few VDS examples. These examples are retrieved via a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism, mitigating the high demand for terminal-specific data. Furthermore, an automatic VDS design workflow is established among these experts to avoid extra manual interventions. In this workflow, a self-correction loop inspired by the LLM Reflexion framework is created", "AI": {"tldr": "PortAgent\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8f66\u8f86\u8c03\u5ea6\u7cfb\u7edf\u79fb\u690d\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6e2f\u53e3\u4e13\u5bb6\u3001\u5c11\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u3001\u5feb\u901f\u90e8\u7f72", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8f66\u8f86\u8c03\u5ea6\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8de8\u7801\u5934\u79fb\u690d\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u5927\u9650\u5236\uff1a\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6e2f\u53e3\u8fd0\u8425\u4e13\u5bb6\u3001\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u7279\u5b9a\u7801\u5934\u6570\u636e\u3001\u8017\u65f6\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u90e8\u7f72\u6d41\u7a0b", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u865a\u62df\u4e13\u5bb6\u56e2\u961f\uff08VET\uff09\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u77e5\u8bc6\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u3001\u5efa\u6a21\u5668\u3001\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u8c03\u8bd5\u5668\uff0c\u91c7\u7528few-shot\u793a\u4f8b\u5b66\u4e60\u548cRAG\u673a\u5236\u83b7\u53d6\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u51faPortAgent\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5b8c\u6210VDS\u79fb\u690d\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eLLM Reflexion\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u81ea\u6821\u6b63\u5faa\u73af", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86VDS\u8de8\u7801\u5934\u79fb\u690d\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0ACTs\u8f66\u8f86\u8c03\u5ea6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5546\u4e1a\u5316\u63a8\u5e7f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848"}}

Including too few passages may omit critical information, while including too many can introduce noise and reduce the quality of the answer. Traditional approaches, such as fixed Top-$K$ retrieval and single-stage reranking, face the dilemma of selecting the right number of passages. This problem is particularly pronounced for factoid questions, which often require only a few specific pieces of evidence. To address this issue, we introduce \\emph{Context-Picker}, a reasoning-aware framework that shifts the paradigm from similarity-based ranking to minimal sufficient subset selection. Context-Picker treats context selection as a decision-making process optimized via a human-inspired, two-stage reinforcement learning schedule: a \\emph{recall-oriented} stage that prioritizes the coverage of reasoning chains, followed by a \\emph{precision-oriented} stage that aggressively prunes redundancy to distill a compact evidence set. To resolve reward sparsity, we propose an offline evidence distillation pipeline that mines \"minimal sufficient sets\" via a Leave-One-Out (LOO) procedure, providing dense, task-aligned supervision. Experiments on five long-context and multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that Context-Picker significantly outperforms strong RAG baselines, achieving superior answer accuracy with comparable or reduced context lengths. Ablation studies indicate that the coarse-to-fine optimization schedule, the redundancy-aware reward shaping, and the rationale-guided format all contribute substantially to these gains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9009\u53d6\u5668\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6", "motivation": "\u957f\u6587\u672cQA\u4e2d\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u6700\u4f18\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u8fc7\u591a\u5f15\u5165\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u8fc7\u5c11\u4e22\u5931\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f", "method": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff1a\u53ec\u56de\u5bfc\u5411\u9636\u6bb5\u8986\u76d6\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u5bfc\u5411\u9636\u6bb5\u4fee\u526a\u5197\u4f59", "result": "\u57285\u4e2a\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u591a\u8df3QA\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eRAG\u57fa\u7ebf", "conclusion": "\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u7ed3\u5408\u5197\u4f59\u611f\u77e5\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u539f\u7406\u6307\u5bfc\u683c\u5f0f\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u6587\u672cQA\u6027\u80fd"}}
