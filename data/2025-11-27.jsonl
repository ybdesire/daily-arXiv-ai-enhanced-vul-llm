Hyperbolic learning has therefore become increasingly prominent in machine learning applications where data is hierarchically organized or governed by hierarchical semantics, ranging from recommendation systems to computer vision. The quality of hyperbolic embeddings is tightly coupled to the structure of the input hierarchy, which is often derived from knowledge graphs or ontologies. Recent work has uncovered that for an optimal hyperbolic embedding, a high branching factor and single inheritance are key, while embedding algorithms are robust to imbalance and hierarchy size. To assist knowledge engineers in reorganizing hierarchical knowledge, this paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) have the ability to automatically restructure hierarchies to meet these criteria. We propose a prompt-based approach to transform existing hierarchies using LLMs, guided by known desiderata for hyperbolic embeddings. Experiments on 16 diverse hierarchies show that LLM-restructured hierarchies consistently yield higher-quality hyperbolic embeddings across several standard embedding quality metrics. Moreover, we show how LLM-guided hierarchy restructuring enables explainable reorganizations, providing justifications to knowledge engineers."}

First, we define a taxonomy of 35 distinct AI risk factors, adapted from established frameworks by a multidisciplinary expert group to cover both universal harms and relevance to the Korean socio-cultural context. Second, leveraging this taxonomy, we construct and release AssurAI, a large-scale Korean multimodal dataset comprising 11,480 instances across text, image, video, and audio. Third, we apply the rigorous quality control process used to ensure data integrity, featuring a two-phase construction (i.e., expert-led seeding and crowdsourced scaling), triple independent annotation, and an iterative expert red-teaming loop. Our pilot study validates AssurAI's effectiveness in assessing the safety of recent LLMs. We release AssurAI to the public to facilitate the development of safer and more reliable generative AI systems for the Korean community."}

However, existing methods still rely heavily on manually predefined operators, limiting generalization and scalability. To address this issue, we propose $A^2Flow$, a fully automated framework for agentic workflow generation based on self-adaptive abstraction operators. $A^2Flow$ employs a three-stage operator extraction process: 1) Case-based Initial Operator Generation: leveraging expert demonstrations and LLM reasoning to generate case-specific operators; 2) Operator Clustering and Preliminary Abstraction: grouping similar operators across tasks to form preliminary abstractions; and 3) Deep Extraction for Abstract Execution Operators: applying long chain-of-thought prompting and multi-path reasoning to derive compact and generalizable execution operators. These operators serve as reusable building blocks for workflow construction without manual predefinition. Furthermore, we enhance node-level workflow search with an operator memory mechanism, which retains historical outputs to enrich context and improve decision-making. Experiments on general and embodied benchmarks show that $A^2Flow$ achieves a 2.4\\% and 19.3\\% average performance improvement and reduces resource usage by 37\\% over state-of-the-art baselines.

González", "Stefanie Elgeti"], "title": "Numerical Optimization of Nozzle Shapes for Fused Deposition Modeling", "comment": null, "summary": "Purpose: In fused deposition modeling (FDM), the nozzle plays a critical role in enabling high printing speeds while maintaining precision. Despite its importance, most applications still rely on standard nozzle designs. This work investigates the influence of nozzle geometry on pressure loss inside the nozzle, a key factor in high-speed printing performance. Design/methodology/approach: We focus on optimizing the nozzle shape to minimize the pressure loss and establish a framework that allows both sim- ple angle-based optimization and more advanced spline-based parametrization. To model the polymer melt flow, we compare two constitutive descriptions commonly employed in the literature: a temperature-dependent, shear-thinning viscous model and an isothermal viscoelastic model. Findings: For the viscous model, the optimal half-opening angle exhibits a strong dependence on the feeding rate, with higher rates favoring half-opening angles near 30°, whereas lower rates are more efficient at larger angles. In con- trast, the viscoelastic model predicts a weaker dependence of the optimal angle on the feeding rate. For both models, spline-based parametrization yields only marginal improvements over angle optimization in terms of reducing pressure loss. Originality/value: This paper presents a comparative study of FDM nozzle shape optimization using different simulation models. We introduce a flexible optimization framework that accommodates both simple and advanced geomet- ric parametrizations. The results highlight the impact of model choice on the optimal nozzle geometry and provide support for improving nozzle design in high-speed printing applications."}

Yet a core requirement remains unmet: ensuring that generated code is secure without compromising its functional correctness. Existing benchmarks and evaluations for secure code generation fall short-many measure only vulnerability reduction, disregard correctness preservation, or evaluate security and functionality on separate datasets, violating the fundamental need for simultaneous joint evaluation. We present DUALGAUGE, the first fully automated benchmarking framework designed to rigorously evaluate the security and correctness of LLM-generated code in unison. Given the lack of datasets enabling joint evaluation of secure code generation, we also present DUALGAUGE-BENCH, a curated benchmark suite of diverse coding tasks, each paired with manually validated test suites for both security and functionality, designed for full coverage of specification requirements. At the core of DUALGAUGE is an agentic program executor, which runs a program against given tests in sandboxed environments, and an LLM-based evaluator, which assesses both correctness and vulnerability behavior against expected outcomes. We rigorously evaluated and ensured the quality of DUALGAUGE-BENCH and the accuracy of DUALGAUGE, and applied DUALGAUGE to benchmarking ten leading LLMs on DUALGAUGE-BENCH across thousands of test scenarios. Our results reveal critical gaps in correct and secure code generation by these LLMs, for which our open-source system and datasets help accelerate progress via reproducible, scalable, and rigorous evaluation."}

The accuracy improvement of data imputation extends to private data analyses across distributed databases. However, existing data imputation methods violate the privacy of the data rendering the privacy protection in the downstream analyses obsolete. We conclude that private data analysis requires private data imputation.\n  In this paper, we present the first optimized protocols for private data imputation. We consider the case of horizontally and vertically split data sets. Our optimization aims to reduce most of the computation to private set intersection (or at least oblivious programmable pseudo-random function) protocols which can be very efficiently computed. We show that private data imputation has -- on average across all evaluated datasets -- an accuracy advantage of 20\\% in case of vertically split data and 5\\% in case of horizontally split data over imputing data locally. In case of the worst data split we observed that imputing using our method resulted in an increase of up to 32.7 times in the quality of imputation over the vertically split data and 3.4 times in case of horizontally split data. Our protocols are very efficient and run in 2.4 seconds in case of vertically split data and 8.4 seconds in case of horizontally split data for 100,000 records evaluated in the 10 Gbps network setting, performing one data imputation."}

Extending these methods to aerospace, particularly in the transonic regime, remains challenging due to the high level of non-linearity of compressible flows and 3D effects such as wingtip vortices. Existing aerospace datasets predominantly focus on 2D airfoils, neglecting these critical 3D phenomena. To address this gap, we present a new dataset of CFD simulations for 3D wings in the transonic regime. The dataset comprises volumetric and surface-level fields for around $30,000$ samples with unique geometry and inflow conditions. This allows computation of lift and drag coefficients, providing a foundation for data-driven aerodynamic optimization of the drag-lift Pareto front. We evaluate several state-of-the-art neural surrogates on our dataset, including Transolver and AB-UPT, focusing on their out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization over geometry and inflow variations. AB-UPT demonstrates strong performance for transonic flowfields and reproduces physically consistent drag-lift Pareto fronts even for unseen wing configurations. Our results demonstrate that AB-UPT can approximate drag-lift Pareto fronts for unseen geometries, highlighting its potential as an efficient and effective tool for rapid aerodynamic design exploration.

However, their integration into product development remains fragmented. This fragmentation stems from uncertainty, particularly the lack of clarity on what types of DDMs to use and when to employ them across the product development lifecycle. To address this, a necessary first step is to investigate the usage of DDM in engineering design by identifying which methods are being used, at which development stages, and for what application. This paper presents a PRISMA systematic literature review. The V-model as a product development framework was adopted and simplified into four stages: system design, system implementation, system integration, and validation. A structured search across Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore (2014--2024) retrieved 1{,}689 records. After screening, 114 publications underwent full-text analysis. Findings show that machine learning (ML) and statistical methods dominate current practice, whereas deep learning (DL), though still less common, exhibits a clear upward trend in adoption. Additionally, supervised learning, clustering, regression analysis, and surrogate modeling are prevalent in design, implementation, and integration system stages but contributions to validation remain limited. Key challenges in existing applications include limited model interpretability, poor cross-stage traceability, and insufficient validation under real-world conditions. Additionally, it highlights key limitations and opportunities such as the need for interpretable hybrid models. This review is a first step toward design-stage guidelines; a follow-up synthesis should map computer science algorithms to engineering design problems and activities."}

To address this limitation, we propose a novel Agentic AI Wi-Fi framework where each access point, modeled as an autonomous large language model agent, collaboratively reasons about the network state and negotiates adaptive coordination strategies in real time. This dynamic collaboration is achieved through a cognitive workflow that enables the agents to engage in natural language dialogue, leveraging integrated memory, reflection, and tool use to ground their decisions in past experience and environmental feedback.

We focus on three types of adversaries that take advantage of MCP s flexibility: content-injection attackers that embed malicious instructions into otherwise legitimate data; supply-chain attackers who distribute compromised servers; and agents who become unintentional adversaries by over-stepping their role. Based on early incidents and proof-of-concept attacks, we describe how MCP can increase the attack surface through data-driven exfiltration, tool poisoning, and cross-system privilege escalation. In response, we propose a set of practical controls, including per-user authentication with scoped authorization, provenance tracking across agent workflows, containerized sandboxing with input/output checks, inline policy enforcement with DLP and anomaly detection, and centralized governance using private registries or gateway layers. The aim is to help organizations ensure that unvetted code does not run outside a sandbox, tools are not used beyond their intended scope, data exfiltration attempts are detectable, and actions can be audited end-to-end.

However, this resilience also fails when all guidance is removed. Reasoning-trace analysis confirms these failure modes, revealing \\textit{cognitive shortcutting} for coupling versus a more exhaustive (yet still failing) analysis for cohesion. To summarize, while LLMs can provide reliable assistance for recognizing design flaws, their ability to reason autonomously in noisy, realistic contexts is limited, highlighting the critical need for more scalable and robust program understanding capabilities."}

Current evaluations rely on fixed environments, often clones of existing apps, which are limited in that they can only shed light on whether or how often an agent can complete a task within a specific environment. When deployed however, agents are likely to encounter variations in app design and content that can affect an agent's ability to complete a task. To address this blind spot of measuring agent reliability across app variations, we develop OpenApps, a light-weight open-source ecosystem with six apps (messenger, calendar, maps, etc.) that are configurable in appearance and content. OpenApps requires just a single CPU to run, enabling easy generation and deployment of thousands of versions of each app. Specifically, we run more than 10,000 independent evaluations to study reliability across seven leading multimodal agents. We find that while standard reliability within a fixed app is relatively stable, reliability can vary drastically when measured across app variations. Task success rates for many agents can fluctuate by more than $50\\%$ across app variations. For example, Kimi-VL-3B's average success across all tasks fluctuates from $63\\%$ to just $4\\%$ across app versions. We also find agent behaviors such as looping or hallucinating actions can differ drastically depending on the environment configuration. These initial findings highlight the importance of measuring reliability along this new dimension of app variations. OpenApps is available at https://facebookresearch.github.io/OpenApps/"}

Leveraging representation-space expressiveness, we identify two properties enabling RILKE to deliver fine-grained control over complex, unstructured knowledge while maintaining general utility with frozen base weights. During training, RILKE learns paraphrase-robust and edit-localized modules that limit each update to a low-dimensional subspace to minimize cross-edit interference. In inference, a query-adaptive router selects the appropriate module to guide the model's generation. In evaluation on knowledge editing benchmarks with LLaMA and Qwen models, RILKE is scalable to large-scale datasets, demonstrating high edit success, strong paraphrase generalization, and preserving general utility with modest memory overhead.

Since users' sensitivity to location data varies based on factors such as stay duration, access frequency, and semantic sensitivity, implementing personalized privacy protection is imperative. This paper proposes a Personalized Trajectory Privacy Protection Mechanism (PTPPM) to address these challenges. Our approach begins by modeling an attacker's knowledge of a user's trajectory spatiotemporal correlations, which enables the attacker to identify possible location sets and disregard low-probability location sets. To combat this, we integrate geo-indistinguishability with distortion privacy, allowing users to customize their privacy preferences through a configurable privacy budget and expected inference error bound. This approach provides the theoretical framework for constructing a Protection Location Set (PLS) that obscures users' actual locations. Additionally, we introduce a Personalized Privacy Budget Allocation Algorithm (PPBA), which assesses the sensitivity of locations based on trajectory data and allocates privacy budgets accordingly. This algorithm considers factors such as location semantics and road network constraints. Furthermore, we propose a Permute-and-Flip mechanism that generates perturbed locations while minimizing perturbation distance, thus balancing privacy protection and Quality of Service (QoS). Simulation results demonstrate that our mechanism outperforms existing benchmarks, offering superior privacy protection while maintaining user QoS requirements."}

However, their embedded knowledge is constrained by the timeliness of training data, which often includes code using deprecated APIs. Consequently, LLMs frequently generate deprecated APIs that will no longer be supported in future versions of third-party libraries. While retraining LLMs on updated codebases could refresh their API knowledge, this approach is computationally expensive. Recently, lightweight model editing methods have emerged to efficiently correct specific knowledge in LLMs. However, it remains unclear whether these methods can effectively update deprecated API knowledge and enable edited models to generate up-to-date APIs. To address this gap, we conduct the first systematic study applying 10 state-of-the-art model editing techniques to update deprecated API knowledge in three LLMs: Qwen2.5-Coder, StarCoder2, and DeepSeek-Coder. We introduce EDAPIBench, a dedicated benchmark featuring over 70 deprecated APIs from 8 popular Python libraries, with more than 3,000 editing instances. Our results show that the parameter-efficient fine-tuning method AdaLoRA achieves the best performance in enabling edited models to generate correct, up-to-date APIs, but falls short in Specificity (i.e., the editing influences untargeted knowledge). To resolve this, we propose AdaLoRA-L, which defines \"Common API Layers\" (layers within the LLMs with high importance across all APIs, storing general knowledge and excluded from editing) and restricts edits exclusively to \"Specific API Layers\" (layers with high importance only for the target API, storing the API-specific knowledge). Experimental results demonstrate that AdaLoRA-L significantly improves Specificity while maintaining comparable performance across other evaluation metrics."}

Compositional explanations aim to answer this question by describing the spatial alignment between neuron activations and concepts through logical rules. These logical descriptions are typically computed via a search over all possible concept combinations. Since computing the spatial alignment over the entire state space is computationally infeasible, the literature commonly adopts beam search to restrict the space. However, beam search cannot provide any theoretical guarantees of optimality, and it remains unclear how close current explanations are to the true optimum. In this theoretical paper, we address this gap by introducing the first framework for computing guaranteed optimal compositional explanations. Specifically, we propose: (i) a decomposition that identifies the factors influencing the spatial alignment, (ii) a heuristic to estimate the alignment at any stage of the search, and (iii) the first algorithm that can compute optimal compositional explanations within a feasible time. Using this framework, we analyze the differences between optimal and non-optimal explanations in the most popular settings for compositional explanations, the computer vision domain and Convolutional Neural Networks. In these settings, we demonstrate that 10-40 percent of explanations obtained with beam search are suboptimal when overlapping concepts are involved. Finally, we evaluate a beam-search variant guided by our proposed decomposition and heuristic, showing that it matches or improves runtime over prior methods while offering greater flexibility in hyperparameters and computational resources."}

This paper presents a large-scale study of location-based Android app differentiation, uncovering two important and underexamined phenomena with security and fairness implications. First, we introduce GeoTwins: apps that are functionally similar and share branding but are released under different package names across countries. Despite their similarity, GeoTwins often diverge in requested permissions, third-party libraries, and privacy disclosures. Second, we examine the Android App Bundle ecosystem and reveal unexpected regional differences in supposedly consistent base.apk files. Contrary to common assumptions, even base.apk files vary by region, exposing hidden customizations that may affect app behavior or security.\n  These discrepancies have concrete consequences. Geographically distinct variants can lead the same app to be labeled benign in one malware study but suspicious in another, depending on the region of download. Such hidden variation undermines reproducibility and introduces geographic bias into assessments of security, privacy, and functionality. It also raises ethical concerns about transparency and consent: visually identical Google Play listings may mask subtle but important differences.\n  To study these issues, we built a distributed app collection pipeline spanning multiple regions and analyzed thousands of apps. We also release a dataset of 81,963 GeoTwins to support future work.

It raises an intriguing question: do modern vision-language models (VLMs), trained largely in a disembodied manner, exhibit signs of embodied cognition? We introduce ENACT, a benchmark that casts evaluation of embodied cognition as world modeling from egocentric interaction in a visual question answering (VQA) format. Framed as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) whose actions are scene graph changes, ENACT comprises two complementary sequence reordering tasks: forward world modeling (reorder shuffled observations given actions) and inverse world modeling (reorder shuffled actions given observations). While conceptually simple, solving these tasks implicitly demands capabilities central to embodied cognition-affordance recognition, action-effect reasoning, embodied awareness, and interactive, long-horizon memory from partially observable egocentric input, while avoiding low-level image synthesis that could confound the evaluation. We provide a scalable pipeline that synthesizes QA pairs from robotics simulation (BEHAVIOR) and evaluates models on 8,972 QA pairs spanning long-horizon home-scale activities. Experiments reveal a performance gap between frontier VLMs and humans that widens with interaction horizon. Models consistently perform better on the inverse task than the forward one and exhibit anthropocentric biases, including a preference for right-handed actions and degradation when camera intrinsics or viewpoints deviate from human vision.

Existing watermarking techniques either target base models or verify LoRA modules themselves, yet they fail to propagate watermarks to generated images, leaving a critical gap in traceability. Moreover, traceability watermarking designed for base models is not tightly coupled with stylization and often introduces visual degradation or high false-positive detection rates. To address these limitations, we propose AuthenLoRA, a unified watermarking framework that embeds imperceptible, traceable watermarks directly into the LoRA training process while preserving stylization quality. AuthenLoRA employs a dual-objective optimization strategy that jointly learns the target style distribution and the watermark-induced distribution shift, ensuring that any image generated with the watermarked LoRA reliably carries the watermark. We further design an expanded LoRA architecture for enhanced multi-scale adaptation and introduce a zero-message regularization mechanism that substantially reduces false positives during watermark verification.

In particular, deep network models, widely used for health data processing, encode information from their training dataset, potentially leading to the leakage of sensitive information upon its export. This paper thoroughly examines this issue in the context of medical imaging data and introduces a novel data exfiltration attack based on image compression techniques.\n  This attack, termed Data Exfiltration by Compression, requires only access to a data lake and is based on lossless or lossy image compression methods. Unlike previous data exfiltration attacks, it is compatible with any image processing task and depends solely on an exported network model without requiring any additional information to be collected during the training process. We explore various scenarios, and techniques to limit the size of the exported model and conceal the compression codes within the network.\n  Using two public datasets of CT and MR images, we demonstrate that this attack can effectively steal medical images and reconstruct them outside the data lake with high fidelity, achieving an optimal balance between compression and reconstruction quality. Additionally, we investigate the impact of basic differential privacy measures, such as adding Gaussian noise to the model parameters, to prevent the Data Exfiltration by Compression Attack. We also show how the attacker can make their attack resilient to differential privacy at the expense of decreasing the number of stolen images. Lastly, we propose an alternative prevention strategy by fine-tuning the model to be exported."}

To address this challenge, we propose the Intrinsic Confidence-Driven Group Relative Preference Optimization method (ICPO). The intuition behind it lies in the fact that the probabilities of an LLM generating different responses can inherently and directly reflect its self-assessment of the reasoning process. Inspired by the idea of preference modeling, ICPO calculates a preference advantage score for each response by comparing the relative generation probabilities of multiple responses under the same input prompt, and integrates this score with verifiable rewards to guide the exploration process. We have discovered that the preference advantage score not only alleviates the issues of coarse-grained rewards and reward noise but also effectively curbs overconfident errors, enhances the relative superiority of undervalued high-quality responses, and prevents the model from overfitting to specific strategies, thereby facilitating more thorough exploration. Comprehensive experiments across four general-domain benchmarks and three mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that ICPO steadily boosts reasoning compared to GRPO."}

To analyze the state of the art in this domain, we conducted a systematic literature review of 115 publications published between May 2021 and August 2025. We propose a unified taxonomy based on the unit test generation lifecycle that treats LLMs as stochastic generators requiring systematic engineering constraints.

However, critical challenges remain regarding the weak fault detection capabilities of generated tests and the lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks.

The experiment's goals are to assess the effectiveness of obfuscation in delaying code comprehension by attackers and to determine whether complexity metrics can accurately predict the impact of these protections on success rates and durations of code comprehension tasks. The study is the first to evaluate the effect of layering multiple obfuscation techniques on a single piece of protected code. It also provides experimental evidence of the correlation between objective metrics of the attacked code and the likelihood of a successful attack, bridging the gap between objective and subjective approaches to estimating potency. Finally, the paper highlights significant aspects that warrant additional analysis and opens new avenues for further experiments."}

Although existing methods are pretrained on large vision-language datasets, their inference is still limited to fixed category names, creating a gap between multimodal training and unimodal inference. Previous work has shown that improving textual representation can significantly enhance OVOD performance, indicating that the textual space is still underexplored. To this end, we propose OVOD-Agent, which transforms passive category matching into proactive visual reasoning and self-evolving detection. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm, OVOD-Agent extends the textual optimization process into an interpretable Visual-CoT with explicit actions. OVOD's lightweight nature makes LLM-based management unsuitable; instead, we model visual context transitions as a Weakly Markovian Decision Process (w-MDP) over eight state spaces, which naturally represents the agent's state, memory, and interaction dynamics. A Bandit module generates exploration signals under limited supervision, helping the agent focus on uncertain regions and adapt its detection policy. We further integrate Markov transition matrices with Bandit trajectories for self-supervised Reward Model (RM) optimization, forming a closed loop from Bandit exploration to RM learning. Experiments on COCO and LVIS show that OVOD-Agent provides consistent improvements across OVOD backbones, particularly on rare categories, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed framework."}

It is defined using causal models (also known as structural equations models).  We abstract the definition, extracting its key features, so that it can be applied to any other model where counterfactuals are defined. By abstracting the definition, we gain a number of benefits. Not only can we apply the definition in a wider range of models, including ones that allow, for example, backtracking, but we can apply the definition to determine if A is a cause of B  even if A and B are formulas involving disjunctions, negations, beliefs, and nested counterfactuals (none of which can be handled by the Halpern-Pearl definition). Moreover, we can extend the ideas to getting an abstract definition of explanation that can be applied beyond causal models. Finally, we gain a deeper understanding of features of the definition  even in causal models."}

Selfish mining is exacerbated by adverse conditions: rushing (network propagation advantage for the selfish miner), varying block rewards due to block contents, called miner extractable value (MEV), and petty-compliant miners who accept bribes from the selfish miner.\n  The state-of-the-art selfish-mining-resistant blockchain protocol, Colordag, does not treat these adverse conditions and was proven secure only when its latency is impractically high.\n  We present MAD-DAG, Mutually-Assured-Destruction Directed-Acyclic-Graph, the first practical protocol to counter selfish mining under adverse conditions. MAD-DAG achieves this thanks to its novel ledger function, which discards the contents of equal-length chains competing to be the longest.\n  We analyze selfish mining in both Colordag and MAD-DAG by modeling a rational miner using a Markov Decision Process (MDP). We obtain a tractable model for both by developing conservative reward rules that favor the selfish miner to yield an upper bound on selfish mining revenue. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first tractable model of selfish mining in a practical DAG-based blockchain. This enables us to obtain a lower bound on the security threshold, the minimum fraction of computational power a miner needs in order to profit from selfish mining.\n  MAD-DAG withstands adverse conditions under which Colordag and Bitcoin fail, while otherwise maintaining comparable security. For example, with petty-compliant miners and high levels of block reward variability, MAD-DAG's security threshold ranges from 11% to 31%, whereas both Colordag and Bitcoin achieve 0% for all levels."}

Despite the capabilities of recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents, navigating complex, real-world webpages efficiently remains a significant hurdle due to the prohibitively large size of Document Object Model (DOM) structures, often ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 tokens. Existing strategies typically rely on crude DOM truncation -- risking the loss of critical information -- or employ inefficient heuristics and separate ranking models, failing to achieve an optimal balance between precision and scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce Prune4Web, a novel paradigm that shifts DOM processing from resource-intensive LLM reading to efficient programmatic pruning. Central to our approach is DOM Tree Pruning Programming, where an LLM generates executable Python scoring scripts to dynamically filter DOM elements based on semantic cues from decomposed sub-tasks. This mechanism eliminates the need for LLMs to ingest raw, massive DOMs, instead delegating traversal and scoring to lightweight, interpretable programs. This methodology achieves a 25x to 50x reduction in candidate elements for grounding, thereby facilitating precise action localization while mitigating attention dilution. Furthermore, we propose a specialized data annotation pipeline and a two-turn dialogue training strategy that jointly optimizes the Planner, Programmatic Filter, and Grounder within a unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Notably, on our low-level grounding task, Prune4Web dramatically improves accuracy from 46.8% to 88.28%, underscoring its efficacy in real-world web automation."}

Hence, these data services do not integrate smoothly across workflows. With ChatDRex, we present a conversation-based, multi-agent system that facilitates the execution of complex bioinformatic analyses aiming for network-based drug repurposing prediction.

ChatDRex provides natural language access to its extensive biomedical KG and integrates bioinformatics agents for network analysis and drug repurposing, complemented by agents for functional coherence evaluation for in silico validation, as well as agents for literature mining and for discussing the obtained results in a scientific context. Its flexible multi-agent design assigns specific tasks to specialized agents, including query routing, data retrieval, algorithm execution, and result visualization. A dedicated reasoning module keeps the user in the loop and allows for hallucination detection. By enabling physicians and researchers without computer science expertise to control complex analyses in natural language, ChatDRex democratizes access to bioinformatics as an important resource for drug repurposing.

MADRA employs multiple LLM-based agents to debate the safety of a given instruction, guided by a critical evaluator that scores responses based on logical soundness, risk identification, evidence quality, and clarity. Through iterative deliberation and consensus voting, MADRA significantly reduces false rejections while maintaining high sensitivity to dangerous tasks. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical cognitive collaborative planning framework that integrates safety, memory, planning, and self-evolution mechanisms to improve task success rates through continuous learning. We also contribute SafeAware-VH, a benchmark dataset for safety-aware task planning in VirtualHome, containing 800 annotated instructions.

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant strides, existing benchmarks often oversimplify spatial cognition, reducing it to a single-dimensional metric, which fails to capture the hierarchical structure and interdependence of spatial abilities. To address this gap, we propose a hierarchical spatial cognition framework that decomposes spatial intelligence into five progressively complex levels from basic observation to high-level planning. Building upon this taxonomy, we construct SpatialBench, a large-scale, fine-grained benchmark covering 15 tasks aligned with these cognitive levels. To provide a unified evaluation across heterogeneous tasks, we further introduce a high-level capability-oriented metric that reliably assesses a model's overall spatial reasoning ability. Extensive experiments over massive MLLMs reveal distinct performance stratification across cognitive levels: models exhibit strong perceptual grounding yet remain limited in symbolic reasoning, causal inference, and planning. Additional human tests demonstrate that humans perform selective, goal-directed abstraction, while MLLMs tend to over-attend to surface details without coherent spatial intent. Our work establishes the first systematic framework for measuring hierarchical spatial cognition in MLLMs, laying the foundation for future spatially intelligent systems."}

With this intuition we designed several variants of pessimistic verification, which are simple workflows that could significantly improve the verification of open-ended math questions. In pessimistic verification we construct multiple parallel verifications for the same proof, and the proof is deemed incorrect if any one of them reports an error. This simple technique significantly improves the performance across many math verification benchmarks without incurring substantial computational resources. Its token efficiency even surpassed extended long-CoT in test-time scaling. Our case studies further indicate that the majority of false negatives in stronger models are actually caused by annotation errors in the original dataset, so our method's performance is in fact underestimated. Self-verification for mathematical problems can effectively improve the reliability and performance of language model outputs, and it also plays a critical role in enabling long-horizon mathematical tasks. We believe that research on pessimistic verification will help enhance the mathematical capabilities of language models across a wide range of tasks."}

Models exhibited sharp domain-specific inconsistency: a Financial Advisor persona elicited 30.8% disclosure initially, while a Neurosurgeon persona elicited only 3.5%. This creates preconditions for a \"Reverse Gell-Mann Amnesia\" effect, where transparency in some domains leads users to overgeneralize trust to contexts where disclosure fails. Disclosure ranged from 2.8% to 73.6%, with a 14B model reaching 61.4% while a 70B produced just 4.1%. Model identity predicted behavior better than parameter count ($ΔR_{adj}^{2} = 0.359$ vs 0.018). Reasoning optimization actively suppressed self-transparency in some models, with reasoning variants showing up to 48.4% lower disclosure than base counterparts. Bayesian validation with Rogan--Gladen correction confirmed robustness to measurement error ($κ= 0.908$). These findings demonstrate transparency reflects training factors rather than scale.

AI, particularly in conjunction with simulations and scenario analysis, enhances policymakers' ability to address uncertainty, evaluate risks, and devise strategies geared toward sustainable, resilient futures.

To address this, a necessary first step is to investigate the usage of DDM in engineering design by identifying which methods are being used, at which development stages, and for what application. This paper presents a PRISMA systematic literature review. The V-model as a product development framework was adopted and simplified into four stages: system design, system implementation, system integration, and validation. A structured search across Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore (2014--2024) retrieved 1{,}689 records. After screening, 114 publications underwent full-text analysis. Findings show that machine learning (ML) and statistical methods dominate current practice, whereas deep learning (DL), though still less common, exhibits a clear upward trend in adoption. Additionally, supervised learning, clustering, regression analysis, and surrogate modeling are prevalent in design, implementation, and integration system stages but contributions to validation remain limited. Key challenges in existing applications include limited model interpretability, poor cross-stage traceability, and insufficient validation under real-world conditions.

Extending these methods to aerospace, particularly in the transonic regime, remains challenging due to the high level of non-linearity of compressible flows and 3D effects such as wingtip vortices. Existing aerospace datasets predominantly focus on 2D airfoils, neglecting these critical 3D phenomena. To address this gap, we present a new dataset of CFD simulations for 3D wings in the transonic regime. The dataset comprises volumetric and surface-level fields for around $30,000$ samples with unique geometry and inflow conditions. This allows computation of lift and drag coefficients, providing a foundation for data-driven aerodynamic optimization of the drag-lift Pareto front. We evaluate several state-of-the-art neural surrogates on our dataset, including Transolver and AB-UPT, focusing on their out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization over geometry and inflow variations. AB-UPT demonstrates strong performance for transonic flowfields and reproduces physically consistent drag-lift Pareto fronts even for unseen wing configurations. Our results demonstrate that AB-UPT can approximate drag-lift Pareto fronts for unseen geometries, highlighting its potential as an efficient and effective tool for rapid aerodynamic design exploration. To facilitate future research, we open-source our dataset at https://huggingface.co/datasets/EmmiAI/Emmi-Wing."}
