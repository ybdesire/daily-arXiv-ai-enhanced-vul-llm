It addresses the growing risks posed by SEAs, highly relevant in the context physical cyber places, such as travellers at airports and residents in smart cities, and synthesizes findings from peer reviewed studies, industry and government reports to inform effective countermeasures that can be embedded into future smart city strategies. SEAs increasingly sidestep technical controls by weaponising leaked personal data and behavioural cues, an urgency underscored by the Optus, Medibank and now Qantas (2025) mega breaches that placed millions of personal records in criminals' hands. Our review surfaces three critical dimensions: (i) human factors of knowledge, abilities and behaviours (KAB) (ii) organisational culture and informal norms that shape those behaviours and (iii) attacker motivations, techniques and return on investment calculations. Our contributions are threefold: (1) TriLayer Systematisation: to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to unify KAB metrics, cultural drivers and attacker economics into a single analytical lens, enabling practitioners to see how vulnerabilities, norms and threat incentives coevolve. (2) Risk Weighted HAISQ Meta analysis: By normalising and ranking HAISQ scores across recent field studies, we reveal persistent high risk clusters (Internet and Social Media use) and propose impact weightings that make the instrument predictive rather than descriptive.

Unfortunately, the vulnerability of existing LLM fingerprinting for the ensemble scenario is unexplored. In order to comprehensively assess the robustness of LLM fingerprinting, in this paper, we propose two novel fingerprinting attack methods: token filter attack (TFA) and sentence verification attack (SVA). The TFA gets the next token from a unified set of tokens created by the token filter mechanism at each decoding step. The SVA filters out fingerprint responses through a sentence verification mechanism based on perplexity and voting.

Currently, an in-laboratory paradigm, called evidence accumulation modelling (EAM), points out that human decision-making involves transforming external evidence into internal mental beliefs. However, the gap in evidence affordance between real-world contexts and laboratory settings hinders the effective application of EAM. Here we generalize EAM to the real world and conduct analysis in real-world driving scenarios. A cognitive scheme is proposed to formalize real-world evidence affordance and capture active sensing through eye movements. Empirically, our scheme can plausibly portray the accumulation of drivers' mental beliefs, explaining how active sensing transforms evidence into mental beliefs from the perspective of information utility. Also, our results demonstrate a negative correlation between evidence affordance and attention recruited by individuals, revealing how human drivers adapt their evidence-collection patterns across various contexts. Moreover, we reveal the positive influence of evidence affordance and attention distribution on decision-making propensity.

Recently, the statistics and machine learning communities have developed prediction-oriented inference approaches that provide better calibrated uncertainties and adapt to the level of misspecification present. However, these approaches have yet to be demonstrated in the context of complex scientific applications where phenomena of interest are governed by physics-based models. Such settings often involve single realizations of high-dimensional spatio-temporal data and nonlinear, computationally expensive parameter-to-observable maps. This work investigates variational prediction-oriented inference in problems exhibiting these relevant features; namely, we consider a polynomial model and a contaminant transport problem governed by advection-diffusion equations. The prediction-oriented loss is formulated as the log-predictive probability of the calibration data. We study the effects of increasing misspecification and noise, and we assess approximations of the predictive density using Monte Carlo sampling and component-wise kernel density estimation. A novel aspect of this work is applying prediction-oriented inference to the calibration of model-form uncertainty (MFU) representations, which are embedded physics-based modifications to the governing equations that aim to reduce (but rarely eliminate) model misspecification.

We formalize this in a Markov decision process with a stochastic human-initiated shutdown event. Building on results on convergent instrumental incentives, we show that for almost all reward functions a misaligned agent has an incentive to avoid shutdown. We then derive closed-form thresholds for when confronting humans yields higher expected utility than compliant behavior, as a function of the discount factor $\u03b3$, shutdown probability $p$, and confrontation cost $C$. For example, a far-sighted agent ($\u03b3=0.99$) facing $p=0.01$ can have a strong takeover incentive unless $C$ is sufficiently large. We contrast this with aligned objectives that impose large negative utility for harming humans, which makes confrontation suboptimal. In a strategic 2-player model (human policymaker vs AGI), we prove that if the AGI's confrontation incentive satisfies $\u0394\\ge 0$, no stable cooperative equilibrium exists: anticipating this, a rational human will shut down or preempt the system, leading to conflict. If $\u0394< 0$, peaceful coexistence can be an equilibrium. We discuss implications for reward design and oversight, extend the reasoning to multi-agent settings as conjectures, and note computational barriers to verifying $\u0394< 0$, citing complexity results for planning and decentralized decision problems.

Rather than assuming explicit feedback definitions, the proposed method exploits action-induced environmental differences to identify target feedback that is not specified in advance, based on the observation that actions inevitably produce measurable changes in the environment. In addition, a self-triggering mechanism, driven by internal objectives such as improved accuracy, precision, and efficiency, is introduced to autonomously plan and adjust actions, thereby enabling faster and more focused feedback acquisition without external commands.

The architecture integrates convolutional self-attention, physically informed padding, and a flood-fill corrector method to maintain accuracy under extreme extrapolation, while conditioning on simulation parameters allows for flexible time-step skipping and adaptation to varying alloy compositions. To remove the need for costly solver-based initialization, we couple the surrogate with a conditional diffusion model that generates synthetic, physically consistent initial conditions. We train our surrogate on simulations generated over small domain sizes and short time spans, but, by taking advantage of the convolutional nature of U-Nets, we are able to run and extrapolate surrogate simulations for longer time horizons than what would be achievable with classic numerical solvers. Across multiple alloy compositions, the framework is able to reproduce the LMD physics accurately. It predicts key quantities of interest and spatial statistics with relative errors typically below 5% in the training regime and under 15% during large-scale, long time-horizon extrapolations.

It also provides critical insights into their current limitations, particularly their struggle to follow explicit instructions.

Despite significant research efforts, existing state-of-the-art approaches for CABP are exclusively heuristic or metaheuristic in nature, and exact methods have been limited to restricted graph classes. In this paper, we present the first exact approach for the CABP on general graphs, based on SAT solving, called SAT-CAB. The proposed method is able to systematically explore the solution space and guarantee global optimality, overcoming the limitations of previously reported heuristic algorithms. This approach relies on a novel and efficient SAT encoding of CABP, in which the problem is transformed into a sequence of At-Most-One constraints. In particular, we introduce a compact representation of the At-Most-One constraints inherent to CABP, which significantly reduces the size of the resulting formulas and enables modern SAT solvers to effectively explore the solution space and to certify global optimality. Extensive computational experiments on standard benchmark instances show that the proposed method efficiently solves CABP instances of practical relevance, while identifying several previously unknown optimal solutions. Moreover, global optimal cyclic antibandwidth values are proven for a number of benchmark instances for the first time. Comparative results indicate that SAT-CAB consistently matches or surpasses the best-known solutions obtained by state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms such as MS-GVNS, HABC-CAB, and MACAB, as well as strong commercial Constraint Programming and Mixed Integer Programming solvers like CPLEX and Gurobi, particularly on general graphs, while also providing optimality guarantees.

As a result, the longer-term evolution of exploitation behavior and its regional characteristics has remained insufficiently understood. In this paper, we present a longitudinal measurement study of Log4Shell-related traffic observed between December 2021 and October 2025 by an active network telescope deployed in India. This vantage point enables examination of sustained exploitation dynamics beyond the initial outbreak phase, including changes in scanning breadth, infrastructure reuse, payload construction, and destination targeting. Our analysis reveals that Log4Shell exploitation persists for several years after disclosure, with activity gradually concentrating around a smaller set of recurring scanner and callback infrastructures, accompanied by an increase in payload obfuscation and shifts in protocol and port usage. A comparative analysis and observations with the benchmark study validate both correlated temporal trends and systematic differences attributable to vantage point placement and coverage.

Qualitative and survey based studies of SOC practice done before reveal that poor alert quality and alert overload greatly augment the burden on the analyst, especially when tool outputs are not coherent with decision requirements, or signal noise. One of the most significant limitations is that model confidence is usually shown without expressing that there are asymmetric costs in decision making where false alarms are much less harmful than missed attacks.

The framework combines confidence that has been calibrated, lightweight uncertainty cues, and cost-sensitive decision thresholds into coherent decision-support layer, instead of making changes to detection models. To enhance probabilistic consistency, the calibration is done using the known post-hoc methods and the uncertainty cues give conservative protection in situations where model certainty is low. To measure the model-independent performance of the suggested model, we apply the Logistic Regression and the Random Forest classifiers to the UNSW-NB15 intrusion detection benchmark.

However, this introduces a security risk where attackers can inject malicious code into the models they upload to these hubs, leading to various kinds of attacks including remote code execution (RCE), sensitive data exfiltration, and system file modification when these models are loaded or executed (predict function). Since AI models play a critical role in digital transformation, this would drastically increase the number of software supply chain attacks. While there are several efforts at detecting malware when deserializing pickle based saved models (hiding malware in model parameters), the risk of abusing DL APIs (e.g. TensorFlow APIs) is understudied. Specifically, we show how one can abuse hidden functionalities of TensorFlow APIs such as file read/write and network send/receive along with their persistence APIs to launch attacks. It is concerning to note that existing scanners in model hubs like Hugging Face and TensorFlow Hub are unable to detect some of the stealthy abuse of such APIs. This is because scanning tools only have a syntactically identified set of suspicious functionality that is being analysed. They often do not have a semantic-level understanding of the functionality utilized. After demonstrating the possible attacks, we show how one may identify potentially abusable hidden API functionalities using LLMs and build scanners to detect such abuses.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this paper, we show how automated common- sense reasoning technology can be deployed in situations where there are not enough data samples available to train a deep learning-based AV model that can handle certain abnormal road scenarios. Specifically, we consider two situations where (i) a traffic signal is malfunctioning at an intersection and (ii) all the cars ahead are slowing down and steering away due to an unexpected obstruction (e.g., animals on the road). We show that in such situations, our commonsense reasoning-based solution accurately detects traffic light colors and obstacles not correctly captured by the AV's perception model. We also provide a pathway for efficiently invoking commonsense reasoning by measuring uncertainty in the computer vision model and using commonsense reasoning to handle uncertain sce- narios.

To address the fundamental gap between PUF designs and security qualifications, this work proposes a novel, formal, and unified framework for evaluating PUF security against modelling attacks by providing security lower bounds, independent of specific attack models or learning algorithms.

Decentralised identity frameworks offer better data sovereignty and eliminate single points of failure but introduce new security concerns, particularly around mu-tual trust among distributed devices.

Once trust is established, QKD generates symmetric keys for encrypting biometric data in transit. Qiskit-based sim-ulations show a key generation rate of 15 bits/sec and 89% efficiency.

Recent findings have shown that even in this scenario, private data can be reconstructed only using information about model parameters. Current efforts to mitigate this are mainly focused on reducing privacy risks on the server side, assuming that other clients will not act maliciously.

In response, we propose $PC^2$, the first black-box political jailbreaking framework for T2I models.

Prior work that uses the Stereotype Content Model (SCM) has focused mostly on single-group bias along warmth and competence. We broaden that lens to intersectional bias by building compound representations for pairs of social identities through summation or concatenation, and by applying three debiasing strategies: Subtraction, Linear Projection, and Partial Projection. We study three widely used embedding families (Word2Vec, GloVe, and ConceptNet Numberbatch) and assess them with two complementary views of utility: whether local neighborhoods remain coherent and whether analogy behavior is preserved. Across models, SCM-based mitigation carries over well to the intersectional case and largely keeps the overall semantic landscape intact. The main cost is a familiar trade off: methods that most tightly preserve geometry tend to be more cautious about analogy behavior, while more assertive projections can improve analogies at the expense of strict neighborhood stability. Partial Projection is reliably conservative and keeps representations steady; Linear Projection can be more assertive; Subtraction is a simple baseline that remains competitive. The choice between summation and concatenation depends on the embedding family and the application goal. Together, these findings suggest that intersectional debiasing with SCM is practical in static embed- dings, and they offer guidance for selecting aggregation and debiasing settings when balancing stability against analogy performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

These mechanism intensify under three conditions: shared vocabulary masking divergent processes, social pressure for immediate judgment, and delayed feedback. These findings extend to AI routing architectures (MoE systems, multi-model orchestration, tool-using agents, RAG systems) exhibiting routing-induced failures (wrong specialist selected) and coverage-induced failures (no appropriate specialist exists).

We optimize CIEA using two complementary contrastive losses to ensure semantic integrity and effectively capture the complementary information contained in images.

We introduce \\textbf{AgentDevel}, a release engineering pipeline that iteratively runs the current agent, produces implementation-blind, symptom-level quality signals from execution traces, synthesizes a single release candidate (RC) via executable diagnosis, and promotes it under flip-centered gating. AgentDevel features three core designs: (i) an implementation-blind LLM critic that characterizes failure appearances without accessing agent internals, (ii) script-based executable diagnosis that aggregates dominant symptom patterns and produces auditable engineering specifications, and (iii) flip-centered gating that prioritizes pass to fail regressions and fail to pass fixes as first-class evidence.

These systems are compounded by specialized agents, which collaborate through explicit communication, but incur substantial computational overhead. A natural question arises: can we achieve similar modularity benefits with a single agent that selects from a library of skills? We explore this question by viewing skills as internalized agent behaviors. From this perspective, a multi-agent system can be compiled into an equivalent single-agent system, trading inter-agent communication for skill selection. Our preliminary experiments suggest this approach can substantially reduce token usage and latency while maintaining competitive accuracy on reasoning benchmarks. However, this efficiency raises a deeper question that has received little attention: how does skill selection scale as libraries grow?\n  Drawing on principles from cognitive science, we propose that LLM skill selection exhibits bounded capacity analogous to human decision-making. We investigate the scaling behavior of skill selection and observe a striking pattern. Rather than degrading gradually, selection accuracy remains stable up to a critical library size, then drops sharply, indicating a phase transition reminiscent of capacity limits in human cognition. Furthermore, we find evidence that semantic confusability among similar skills, rather than library size alone, plays a central role in this degradation. This perspective suggests that hierarchical organization, which has long helped humans manage complex choices, may similarly benefit AI systems. Our initial results with hierarchical routing support this hypothesis. This work opens new questions about the fundamental limits of semantic-based skill selection in LLMs and offers a cognitive-grounded framework and practical guidelines for designing scalable skill-based agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, their performance mainly stems from thinking, a long Chain of Thought (CoT), which significantly increase computational overhead. To address this overthinking problem, existing work focuses on using reinforcement learning (RL) to train hybrid reasoning models that automatically decide whether to engage in thinking or not based on the complexity of the query. Unfortunately, using RL will suffer the the reward hacking problem, e.g., the model engages in thinking but is judged as not doing so, resulting in incorrect rewards. To mitigate this problem, existing works either employ supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which incurs high computational costs, or enforce uniform token limits on non-thinking responses, which yields limited mitigation of the problem. In this paper, we propose Thinking-Based Non-Thinking (TNT). It does not employ SFT, and sets different maximum token usage for responses not using thinking across various queries by leveraging information from the solution component of the responses using thinking. Experiments on five mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that TNT reduces token usage by around 50% compared to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B/7B and DeepScaleR-1.5B, while significantly improving accuracy.

This representation prevents the combinatorial explosion typical of pairwise expansions and explicitly preserves the co-occurrence context of scientific formulations. We further demonstrate that equipping agentic systems with hypergraph traversal tools, specifically using node-intersection constraints, enables them to bridge semantically distant concepts. By exploiting these higher-order pathways, the system successfully generates grounded mechanistic hypotheses for novel composite materials, such as linking cerium oxide to PCL scaffolds via chitosan intermediates.

Existing routing strategies either rely on local token probabilities or post-hoc verification, introducing significant inference overhead. In this work, we propose a novel perspective on step-wise collaboration: the difficulty of a reasoning step can be inferred from its very first token. Inspired by the \"Aha Moment\" phenomenon in LRMs, we show that the entropy of the initial token serves as a strong predictor of step difficulty.

However, this creates a self-consuming retraining loop, where models are trained on their own outputs and may cause performance drops and induce emerging biases. In real-world applications, previously deployed LLMs may influence the data they generate, leading to a dynamic system driven by user feedback. For example, if a model continues to underserve users from a group, less query data will be collected from this particular demographic of users. In this study, we introduce the concept of \\textbf{S}elf-\\textbf{C}onsuming \\textbf{P}erformative \\textbf{L}oop (\\textbf{SCPL}) and investigate the role of synthetic data in shaping bias during these dynamic iterative training processes under controlled performative feedback. This controlled setting is motivated by the inaccessibility of real-world user preference data from dynamic production systems, and enables us to isolate and analyze feedback-driven bias evolution in a principled manner. We focus on two types of loops, including the typical retraining setting and the incremental fine-tuning setting, which is largely underexplored. Through experiments on three real-world tasks, we find that the performative loop increases preference bias and decreases disparate bias. We design a reward-based rejection sampling strategy to mitigate the bias, moving towards more trustworthy self-improving systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce SimuAgent, an LLM-powered modeling and simulation agent tailored for Simulink. SimuAgent replaces verbose XML with a concise, dictionary-style Python representation, dramatically cutting token counts, improving interpretability, and enabling fast, in-process simulation. A lightweight plan-execute architecture, trained in two stages, equips the agent with both low-level tool skills and high-level design reasoning. To tackle sparse rewards in long-horizon tasks, we propose Reflection-GRPO (ReGRPO), which augments Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with self-reflection traces that supply rich intermediate feedback, accelerating convergence and boosting robustness. Experiments on SimuBench, our newly released benchmark comprising 5300 multi-domain modeling tasks, show that a Qwen2.5-7B model fine-tuned with SimuAgent converges faster and achieves higher modeling accuracy than standard RL baselines, and even surpasses GPT-4o when evaluated with few-shot prompting on the same benchmark. Ablations confirm that the two-stage curriculum and abstract-reconstruct data augmentation further enhance generalization. SimuAgent trains and runs entirely on-premise with modest hardware, delivering a privacy-preserving, cost-effective solution for industrial model-driven engineering. SimuAgent bridges the gap between LLMs and graphical modeling environments, offering a practical solution for AI-assisted engineering design in industrial settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Forecasting Accurately predicting stock prices has always been a focal point for various researchers. However, existing statistical approaches for time-series prediction often fail to effectively forecast the probability range of future stock prices. Hence, to solve this problem, the Neural Prophet with a Deep Neural Network (NP-DNN) is proposed to predict stock market prices. The preprocessing technique used in this research is Z-score normalization, which normalizes stock price data by removing scale differences, making patterns easier to detect. Missing value imputation fills gaps in historical data, enhancing the models use of complete information for more accurate predictions. The Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) learns complex nonlinear relationships among stock market prices and extracts hidden patterns from the input data, thereby creating meaningful feature representations for better prediction accuracy. The proposed NP-DNN model achieved an accuracy of 99.21% compared with other approaches using the Fused Large Language Model.

This undermines the reliability of LLM based agents in production systems as it leads to inconsistent results, and bypasses security and audit controls. Such hallucinations in agent tool selection require early detection and error handling. Unlike existing hallucination detection methods that require multiple forward passes or external validation, we present a computationally efficient framework that detects tool-calling hallucinations in real-time by leveraging LLMs' internal representations during the same forward pass used for generation. We evaluate this approach on reasoning tasks across multiple domains, demonstrating strong detection performance (up to 86.4\\% accuracy) while maintaining real-time inference capabilities with minimal computational overhead, particularly excelling at detecting parameter-level hallucinations and inappropriate tool selections, critical for reliable agent deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While world models possess this capability, they most often require action labels, that can be complex to obtain at scale. This motivates the learning of latent action models, that can learn an action space from videos alone. Our work addresses the problem of learning latent actions world models on in-the-wild videos, expanding the scope of existing works that focus on simple robotics simulations, video games, or manipulation data. While this allows us to capture richer actions, it also introduces challenges stemming from the video diversity, such as environmental noise, or the lack of a common embodiment across videos. To address some of the challenges, we discuss properties that actions should follow as well as relevant architectural choices and evaluations. We find that continuous, but constrained, latent actions are able to capture the complexity of actions from in-the-wild videos, something that the common vector quantization does not. We for example find that changes in the environment coming from agents, such as humans entering the room, can be transferred across videos. This highlights the capability of learning actions that are specific to in-the-wild videos. In the absence of a common embodiment across videos, we are mainly able to learn latent actions that become localized in space, relative to the camera. Nonetheless, we are able to train a controller that maps known actions to latent ones, allowing us to use latent actions as a universal interface and solve planning tasks with our world model with similar performance as action-conditioned baselines. Our analyses and experiments provide a step towards scaling latent action models to the real world.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
