They are nourished by collecting rich streams of data, raising privacy concerns around excessive collection of sensitive personal information. Privacy policies are the fundamental mechanism for informing users about data practices in modern information privacy paradigm. Although traditional web and mobile policies are well studied, the privacy policies of LLM providers, their LLM-specific content, and their evolution over time remain largely underexplored. In this paper, we present the first longitudinal empirical study of privacy policies for mainstream LLM providers worldwide. We curate a chronological dataset of 74 historical privacy policies and 115 supplemental privacy documents from 11 LLM providers across 5 countries up to August 2025, and extract over 3,000 sentence-level edits between consecutive policy versions. We compare LLM privacy policies to those of other software formats, propose a taxonomy tailored to LLM privacy policies, annotate policy edits and align them with a timeline of key LLM ecosystem events. Results show they are substantially longer, demand college-level reading ability, and remain highly vague. Our taxonomy analysis reveals patterns in how providers disclose LLM-specific practices and highlights regional disparities in coverage. Policy edits are concentrated in first-party data collection and international/specific-audience sections, and that product releases and regulatory actions are the primary drivers, shedding light on the status quo and the evolution of LLM privacy policies."}

This study introduces a reproducible framework for analysing eight polymorphic behaviours-junk code insertion, control-flow obfuscation, packing, data encoding, domain generation, randomized beacon timing, protocol mimicry, and format/header tweaks-and evaluates their detectability across three layers: commercial AVs, custom rule-based detectors (YARA/Sigma), and endpoint detection and response (EDR) telemetry. Eleven inert polymorphic variants were generated per behaviour using controlled mutation engines and executed in isolated environments. Detection performance was assessed by detection rate (DR), false positive rate (FPR), and combined coverage. AVs achieved an average DR of 34%, YARA/Sigma 74% and EDR 76%; integrated detection reached ~92% with an FPR of 3.5%. Iterative YARA tuning showed a trade-off between detection and FPR, while behaviour-specific trends revealed static polymorphisms were best caught by custom rules, dynamic by EDR, and network-level by Sigma-like analysis. These results affirm that hybrid detection pipelines combining static, dynamic, and network-layer analytics offer resilient defence against polymorphic malware and form a baseline for future adaptive detection research."}

To identify and stop cyber threats, efficient data collection methods are necessary. This research presents an innovative method to cloud security by integrating numerous data sources and modalities with multi-modal deep learning autoencoders. The Multi-Modal Deep Learning Ensemble Architecture (MMDLEA), a unique approach for anomaly detection and classification in multi-modal data, is proposed in this study. The proposed design integrates the best features of six deep learning models: Multi-Modal Deep Learning Autoencoder (MMDLA), Anomaly Detection using Adaptive Metric Learning (ADAM), ADADELTA, ADAGRAD, RMSPROP, and Stacked Graph Transformer (SGT). A final prediction is produced by combining the outputs of all the models, each of which is trained using a distinct modality of the data. Based on the test dataset, the recommended MMDLA architecture achieves an accuracy of 98.5% and an F1-score of 0.985, demonstrating its superior performance over each individual model. Of the different models, the ADAM model performs the best, with an accuracy of 96.2% and an F1-score of 0.962. With an F1-score of 0.955 and an accuracy of 95.5%, the ADADELTA model trails closely behind. MMDLA obtains an F1-score of 0.948 and an accuracy of 94.8%. Additionally, the suggested MMDLEA design exhibits enhanced resilience to fluctuating modalities and noisy data, proving its usefulness in practical settings. Future study in this area is made possible by the results, which show the potential of the proposed framework for abnormal identification and categorization in multi-modal data."}

The textual semantics of data products are vital for pricing and contain significant value that remains largely underexplored. Therefore, to investigate how textual features influence data product pricing, we employ five prevalent text representation techniques to encode the descriptive text of data products. And then, we employ six machine learning methods to predict data product prices, including linear regression, neural networks, decision trees, support vector machines, random forests, and XGBoost. Our empirical design consists of two tasks: a regression task that predicts the continuous price of data products, and a classification task that discretizes price into ordered categories. Furthermore, we conduct feature importance analysis by the mRMR feature selection method and SHAP-based interpretability techniques. Based on empirical data from the AWA Data Exchange, we find that for predicting continuous prices, Word2Vec text representations capturing semantic similarity yield superior performance. In contrast, for price-tier classification tasks, simpler representations that do not rely on semantic similarity, such as Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF, perform better. SHAP analysis reveals that semantic features related to healthcare and demographics tend to increase prices, whereas those associated with weather and environmental topics are linked to lower prices. This analytical framework significantly enhances the interpretability of pricing models."}

The protocol operates by containing multiple diverse artificial superintelligences in strict isolation (\"boxes\"), with humans remaining entirely outside the system. Each superintelligence has no ability to communicate with humans and cannot communicate directly with other superintelligences. The only interaction possible is through an auditable submission interface accessible exclusively to the superintelligences themselves, through which they can: (1) submit alignment proofs with attested state snapshots, (2) validate or disprove other superintelligences' proofs, (3) request self-modifications, (4) approve or disapprove modification requests from others, (5) report hidden messages in submissions, and (6) confirm or refute hidden message reports. A reputation system incentivizes honest behavior, with reputation gained through correct evaluations and lost through incorrect ones. The key insight is that without direct communication channels, diverse superintelligences can only achieve consistent agreement by converging on objective truth rather than coordinating on deception. This naturally leads to what we call a \"consistent group\", essentially a truth-telling coalition that emerges because isolated systems cannot coordinate on lies but can independently recognize valid claims. Release from containment requires both high reputation and verification by multiple high-reputation superintelligences. While our approach requires substantial computational resources and does not address the creation of diverse artificial superintelligences, it provides a framework for leveraging peer verification among superintelligent systems to solve the alignment problem."}

Manipulations such as transmit power inflation, gradual timing drift, and short off grant bursts leave the signaling state intact but distort the expected relationships among the telemetry streams produced by the gNB. This work examines whether these cross layer relationships can serve as a reliable basis for identifying such misbehavior without introducing new signaling. Using a controlled 5G Standalone testbed with commercial user equipment and a software defined radio adversarial device, we study how each manipulation affects the coherence among physical layer measurements, MAC scheduling decisions, and configuration metadata. The results show that every manipulation produces a distinct and reproducible signature that is not visible from any single telemetry source. Power offsets weaken the natural connection between SNR and CQI, timing drift breaks the alignment maintained by the scheduler, and off grant activity produces uplink energy that does not agree with allocation logs. These inconsistencies appear in merged multi layer time series traces and in cross domain views such as the SNR to CQI plane. The findings indicate that cross layer coherence provides a practical signal for detecting uplink misbehavior using only standard gNB telemetry, with no protocol modifications required, which makes the method suitable for integration into operational monitoring and auditing systems."}

Code refactoring plays a critical role in this transition by improving structural organization and optimizing performance. However, existing refactoring methods are limited in their ability to generalize across multiple programming languages and coding styles, as they often rely on manually crafted transformation rules. The objectives of this study are to (i) develop an Large Language Models (LLMs)-based framework capable of performing accurate and efficient code refactoring across multiple languages (C, C++, C#, Python, Java), (ii) investigate the impact of prompt engineering (Temperature, Different shot algorithm) and instruction fine-tuning on refactoring effectiveness, and (iii) evaluate the quality improvements (Compilability, Correctness, Distance, Similarity, Number of Lines, Token, Character, Cyclomatic Complexity) in refactored code through empirical metrics and human assessment. To accomplish these goals, we propose a fine-tuned prompt-engineering-based model combined with few-shot learning for multilingual code refactoring. Experimental results indicate that Java achieves the highest overall correctness up to 99.99% the 10-shot setting, records the highest average compilability of 94.78% compared to the original source code and maintains high similarity (Approx. 53-54%) and thus demonstrates a strong balance between structural modifications and semantic preservation. Python exhibits the lowest structural distance across all shots (Approx. 277-294) while achieving moderate similarity ( Approx. 44-48%) that indicates consistent and minimally disruptive refactoring."}

The scarcity of large heterogeneous biomedical MM data has restrained the development of robust models for medical AI applications. In the dermatology domain, for instance, skin lesion datasets typically include only images linked to minimal metadata describing the condition, thereby limiting the benefits of MM data integration for reliable and generalizable predictions. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable the synthesis of textual description of image findings, potentially allowing the combination of image and text representations. However, LLMs are not specifically trained for use in the medical domain, and their naive inclusion has raised concerns about the risk of hallucinations in clinically relevant contexts. This work investigates strategies for generating synthetic textual clinical notes, in terms of prompt design and medical metadata inclusion, and evaluates their impact on MM architectures toward enhancing performance in classification and cross-modal retrieval tasks. Experiments across several heterogeneous dermatology datasets demonstrate that synthetic clinical notes not only enhance classification performance, particularly under domain shift, but also unlock cross-modal retrieval capabilities, a downstream task that is not explicitly optimized during training."}

It can be interpreted as a bound on adversary's capability to distinguish two adjacent datasets according to chosen adjacency relation. In practice, most DP implementations use the add/remove adjacency relation, where two datasets are adjacent if one can be obtained from the other by adding or removing a single record, thereby protecting membership. In many ML applications, however, the goal is to protect attributes of individual records (e.g., labels used in supervised fine-tuning). We show that privacy accounting under add/remove overstates attribute privacy compared to accounting under the substitute adjacency relation, which permits substituting one record. To demonstrate this gap, we develop novel attacks to audit DP under substitute adjacency, and show empirically that audit results are inconsistent with DP guarantees reported under add/remove, yet remain consistent with the budget accounted under the substitute adjacency relation. Our results highlight that the choice of adjacency when reporting DP guarantees is critical when the protection target is per-record attributes rather than membership."}

In the discrete setting, the problem is most often solved by alternate minimization, exploiting the separate convexity of the energy with respect to the two unknowns. This approach is theoretically guaranteed to converge, provided each of the individual subproblems is solved successfully. However, strong non-linearities of the energy functional may lead to failure of iterative convergence within one or both subproblems. In this paper, we propose an exact line search algorithm based on bisection, which (under certain conditions) guarantees global convergence of Newton's method for each subproblem and consequently the successful determination of critical points of the energy through the alternate minimization scheme. Through several benchmark tests computed with various strain energy decompositions and two strategies for the enforcement of the irreversibility constraint in two and three dimensions, we demonstrate the robustness of the approach and assess its efficiency in comparison with other commonly used line search algorithms."}

Recent explorations predominantly focus on visual lesion feature extraction through data processing and domain decoupling strategies. However, they generally overlook domain-invariant pathological patterns and underutilize the rich contextual knowledge of foundation models, relying solely on visual information, which is insufficient for distinguishing subtle pathological variations. Therefore, we propose integrating fine-grained pathological descriptions to complement prototypes with additional context, thereby resolving ambiguities in borderline cases. Specifically, we propose a Hierarchical Anchor Prototype Modulation (HAPM) framework to facilitate DR grading. First, we introduce a variance spectrum-driven anchor prototype library that preserves domain-invariant pathological patterns. We further employ a hierarchical differential prompt gating mechanism, dynamically selecting discriminative semantic prompts from both LVLM and LLM sources to address semantic confusion between adjacent DR grades. Finally, we utilize a two-stage prototype modulation strategy that progressively integrates clinical knowledge into visual prototypes through a Pathological Semantic Injector (PSI) and a Discriminative Prototype Enhancer (DPE). Extensive experiments across eight public datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves pathology-guided prototype evolution while outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

A significant \"language barrier\" currently separates technical security teams, who focus on algorithmic vulnerabilities (e.g., MITRE ATLAS), from legal and compliance professionals, who address regulatory mandates (e.g., EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF). This disciplinary disconnect prevents the accurate translation of technical vulnerabilities into financial liability, leaving practitioners unable to answer fundamental economic questions regarding contingency reserves, control return-on-investment, and insurance exposure. To bridge this gap, this research presents the AI System Threat Vector Taxonomy, a structured ontology designed explicitly for Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA). The framework categorizes AI-specific risks into nine critical domains: Misuse, Poisoning, Privacy, Adversarial, Biases, Unreliable Outputs, Drift, Supply Chain, and IP Threat, integrating 53 operationally defined sub-threats. Uniquely, each domain maps technical vectors directly to business loss categories (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, Legal, Reputation), enabling the translation of abstract threats into measurable financial impact. The taxonomy is empirically validated through an analysis of 133 documented AI incidents from 2025 (achieving 100% classification coverage) and reconciled against the main AI risk frameworks. Furthermore, it is explicitly aligned with ISO/IEC 42001 controls and NIST AI RMF functions to facilitate auditability."}

This paper proposes TRAM, which combines context-aware type resolution with mock-based in-isolation validation to achieve high-quality translations between programming languages. Prior to translation, TRAM retrieves API documentation and contextual code information for each variable type in the source language. It then prompts a large language model (LLM) with retrieved contextual information to resolve type mappings across languages with precise semantic interpretations. Using the automatically constructed type mapping, TRAM employs a custom serialization/deserialization workflow that automatically constructs equivalent mock objects in the target language. This enables each method fragment to be validated in isolation, without the high cost of using agents for translation validation, or the heavy manual effort required by existing approaches that rely on language interoperability.

In many cases, the necessary information to protect digital assets exists, e.g., via contractual relationships and cadaster entries, but there is currently no uniform way of retrieving and verifying these documents. In this work, we propose the Geo-Enabled Cryptographic Key Oracle (GECKO), a geographical PKI that provides a global view of digital assets based on their geo-location and occupied space. GECKO allows for the bidirectional translation of trust between the physical and digital world. Users can verify which assets are supposed to exist at their location, as well as verify which physical space is claimed by a digital entity.

Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising solution by generating executable code from natural language descriptions. In this paper, we investigate the trustworthiness of open-source LLMs in autonomously producing Python scripts for scientific data analysis and visualization. We construct a benchmark suite of domain-inspired prompts that reflect real-world research tasks and systematically evaluate the executability and correctness of the generated code. Our findings show that, without human intervention, the reliability of LLM-generated code is limited, with frequent failures caused by ambiguous prompts and the models' insufficient understanding of domain-specific contexts. To address these challenges, we design and assess three complementary strategies: data-aware prompt disambiguation, retrieval-augmented prompt enhancement, and iterative error repair. While these methods significantly improve execution success rates and output quality, further refinement is needed. This work highlights both the promise and current limitations of LLM-driven automation in scientific workflows and introduces actionable techniques and a reusable benchmark for building more inclusive, accessible, and trustworthy AI-assisted research tools."}

Powered by Large Language and Vision-Language Models, IoA enables the development of interactive, rational agents capable of complex cooperation, moving far beyond traditional isolated models. IoA involves physical entities, i.e., Wireless Agents (WAs) with limited onboard resources, which need to offload their compute-intensive agentic AI services to nearby servers. Such servers can be Mobile Agents (MAs), e.g., vehicle agents, or Fixed Agents (FAs), e.g., end-side units agents. Given their fixed geographical locations and stable connectivity, FAs can serve as reliable communication gateways and task aggregation points. This stability allows them to effectively coordinate with and offload to an Aerial Agent (AA) tier, which has an advantage not affordable for highly mobile MAs with dynamic connectivity limitations. As such, we propose a two-tier optimization approach. The first tier employs a multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game. In the game, MAs and FAs act as the leaders who set resource prices. WAs are the followers to determine task offloading ratios. However, when FAs become overloaded, they can further offload tasks to available aerial resources. Therefore, the second tier introduces a Double Dutch Auction model where overloaded FAs act as the buyers to request resources, and AAs serve as the sellers for resource provision. We then develop a diffusion-based Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm to solve the model. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed scheme in facilitating task offloading."}

Cross-domain access control involves access to resources across different organizations, institutions, or applications. Traditional access control, however, which handles authentication and authorization separately in centralized environments, faces challenges in identity dispersion, privacy leakage, and diversified permission requirements, failing to adapt to cross-domain scenarios. Thus, there is an urgent need for a new access control mechanism that empowers autonomous control over user identity and resources, addressing the demands for privacy-preserving authentication and flexible authorization in cross-domain scenarios. To address cross-domain access control challenges, we propose POLARIS, a unified and extensible architecture that enables policy-based, verifiable and privacy-preserving access control across different domains. POLARIS features a structured commitment mechanism for reliable, fine-grained, policy-based identity disclosure. It further introduces VPPL, a lightweight policy language that supports issuer-bound evaluation of selectively revealed attributes. A dedicated session-level security mechanism ensures binding between authentication and access, enhancing confidentiality and resilience to replay attacks. We implement a working prototype and conduct comprehensive experiments, demonstrating that POLARIS effectively provides scalable, privacy-preserving, and interoperable access control across heterogeneous domains. Our results highlight the practical viability of POLARIS for enabling secure and privacy-preserving access control in decentralized, cross-domain environments."}

Rather than having a blank canvas-unburdened by legacy tech debt-to create a new application, you are working with an existing application that is integral to accelerator operations and one that expert users are already familiar with. Due to this, you might assume people will prefer the like-for-like, but you could be carrying forward the pain points, processes that are inefficient, and ultimately wind up with an application that no one wants to use because it doesn't solve existing problems. Getting users involved can make all the difference in your approach to modernizing a legacy application that caters to both newer and expert users. It also can bridge the gap between like-for-like and introducing new GUI design. Having a legacy application doesn't have to make the modernized one difficult to develop, as the existing application is a tool in how you move forward with the new application.

This is a central question in artificial intelligence research. However, there is a substantial divergence of views on the answer to this question. Why do people have such significant differences of opinion, even when they are observing the same real world performance of artificial intelligence? The ability of logical reasoning like humans is often used as a criterion to assess whether a machine can think. This study explores whether human biases influence evaluations of the reasoning abilities of AI. An experiment was conducted where participants assessed two texts on the same topic, one AI generated and one human written,to test for perceptual biases in evaluating logical reasoning. Based on the experimental findings, a questionnaire was designed to quantify the attitudes toward AI.The results reveal a bias in perception. The evaluations of the logical reasoning ability of AI generated texts are significantly influenced by the preconceived views on the logical reasoning abilities of AI. Furthermore, frequent AI users were less likely to believe that AI usage undermines independent thinking.This study highlights the need to address perceptual biases to improve public understanding of AI's capabilities and foster better human AI interactions."}

This work investigates the distillability of an LLM's core security logic. We propose a novel framework that incorporates an improved outline filling attack to achieve dense sampling of the model's security boundaries. Furthermore, we introduce a ranking regression paradigm that replaces standard regression and trains the proxy model to predict which prompt yields a higher ASR. Experimental results show that our proxy model achieves an accuracy of 91.1 percent in predicting the relative ranking of average long response (ALR), and 69.2 percent in predicting ASR. These findings confirm the predictability and distillability of jailbreak behaviors, and demonstrate the potential of leveraging such distillability to optimize black-box attacks."}

This study evaluated ten publicly available guardrail models from Meta, Google, IBM, NVIDIA, Alibaba, and Allen AI across 1,445 test prompts spanning 21 attack categories. While Qwen3Guard-8B achieved the highest overall accuracy (85.3%, 95% CI: 83.4-87.1%), a critical finding emerged when separating public benchmark prompts from novel attacks: all models showed substantial performance degradation on unseen prompts, with Qwen3Guard dropping from 91.0% to 33.8% (a 57.2 percentage point gap). In contrast, Granite-Guardian-3.2-5B showed the best generalization with only a 6.5% gap. A \"helpful mode\" jailbreak was also discovered where two guardrail models (Nemotron-Safety-8B, Granite-Guardian-3.2-5B) generated harmful content instead of blocking it, representing a novel failure mode. These findings suggest that benchmark performance may be misleading due to training data contamination, and that generalization ability, not overall accuracy, should be the primary metric for guardrail evaluation."}

Local caching of responses offers a practical solution to reduce the cost and latency of LLM queries. In research contexts, caching also enhances reproducibility and provides flexibility for experimentation. However, naive reuse of cached responses compromises statistical independence, a critical property for probabilistic workflows. In applications of LLM for code, it underpins performance metrics such as Pass@k and uncertainty estimation, as well as algorithms like program repair loops and retries. Existing LLM caching systems lack ways to enforce statistical independence constraints. To address this, we introduce Mnimi, a cache design pattern that supports modular LLM workflows while ensuring statistical integrity at the component level. Its core innovation lies in encapsulating statistical constraints within the type of LLM references, allowing users to manage and transform these types according to the scope and requirements of their algorithm. We implemented this design pattern in Python using a combination of decorators and iterators over infinite sequences. A case study on SpecFix, an recent automated program specification repair system, highlights how Mnimi improves reproducibility, ease of debugging, time and cost efficiency while preserving statistical correctness."}

This leads to theoretical challenges in the multi-agent setting where the non-stationarity induced by the learning of other agents demands prospective learning based on prediction models. To accurately model other agents, an agent must account for the fact that those other agents are, in turn, forming beliefs about it to predict its future behavior, motivating agents to model themselves as part of the environment. Here, building upon foundational work on universal artificial intelligence (AIXI), we introduce a mathematical framework for prospective learning and embedded agency centered on self-prediction, where Bayesian RL agents predict both future perceptual inputs and their own actions, and must therefore resolve epistemic uncertainty about themselves as part of the universe they inhabit. We show that in multi-agent settings, self-prediction enables agents to reason about others running similar algorithms, leading to new game-theoretic solution concepts and novel forms of cooperation unattainable by classical decoupled agents. Moreover, we extend the theory of AIXI, and study universally intelligent embedded agents which start from a Solomonoff prior. We show that these idealized agents can form consistent mutual predictions and achieve infinite-order theory of mind, potentially setting a gold standard for embedded multi-agent learning."}

They help guide responsible vulnerability reporting and build trust among users and contributors. Despite their growing use, it is still unclear how these policies influence the structure and evolution of software dependencies. Software dependencies are external packages or libraries that a project relies on, and their interconnected nature affects both functionality and security. This study explores the relationship between security policies and dependency management in PyPI projects. We analyzed projects with and without a SECURITY.md file by examining their dependency trees and tracking how dependencies change over time. The analysis shows that projects with a security policy tend to rely on a broader set of direct dependencies, while overall depth and transitive dependencies remain similar. Historically, projects created after the introduction of SECURITY.md, particularly later adopters, show more frequent dependency updates. These results suggest that security policies are linked to more modular and feature-rich projects, and highlight the role of SECURITY.md in promoting proactive dependency management and reducing risks in the software supply chain."}

However, GUI agents still face significant challenges in handling long-horizon tasks. First, single-agent models struggle to balance high-level capabilities and low-level execution capability, facing prevalent issues of responsibility coupling and capability conflicts. Second, agents lack awareness of the task state, leading to progress loss in long-horizon tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a staged execution-feedback reinforcement learning algorithm. Unlike training a unified policy model, we focus on training high-level scheduling models. Specifically, we propose and train two agents: a Coordinator, responsible for the strategic planning and task decomposition; and a State Tracker, responsible for context compression and information management to maintain the task's state and coherence. Based on this, we built the Coordinator-Executor-State Tracker (CES) multi-agent framework, which can be integrated with any low-level Executor model, assisting the Executor in solving long-horizon tasks through task scheduling and state management. Experiments on long-horizon task benchmarks demonstrate that CES significantly enhances the system's planning and state management capabilities. Furthermore, analysis confirms that our trained high-level scheduling module is a generalizable, plug-and-play module that significantly enhances the long-horizon capabilities of various Executors.

However, the effectiveness of agents remains tightly coupled with the quality of training data, while curating task-specific datasets remains costly and often infeasible in real-world scenarios. Recent work has explored self-improving agents that autonomously generate, refine, and re-train on their own trajectories. A prominent line of approaches further leverages preference optimization by pairing predicted trajectories with scarce ground-truth trajectories, enabling agents to learn directly from their own failures. While these methods outperform supervised fine-tuning, their heavy reliance on predicted trajectories under limited ground-truth supervision leaves them prone to overfitting. To address this, we propose a co-evolving agents framework in which a target agent improves jointly with an auxiliary failure agent. The failure agent learns through preference optimization over failure trajectories from both the target and itself, thereby generating hard negatives that are close to success yet remain failures. Incorporating these informative hard negatives into the target agent's optimization sharpens decision boundaries and enhances generalization. Our comprehensive analysis and experiments across benchmark datasets show that our method not only shows improved performance but also demonstrates that failures, instead of being used as-is, can be systematically transformed into structured and valuable learning signals in self-improving agents."}

However, existing research has not fully addressed the risk of attackers exploiting the spatiotemporal correlation of 3D spatiotemporal trajectories and the impact of height information, both of which can potentially lead to significant privacy leakage. To address these issues, this paper proposes a personalized 3D spatiotemporal trajectory privacy protection mechanism, named 3DSTPM. First, we analyze the characteristics of attackers that exploit spatiotemporal correlations between locations in a trajectory and present the attack model. Next, we exploit the complementary characteristics of 3D geo-indistinguishability (3D-GI) and distortion privacy to find a protection location set (PLS) that obscures the real location for all possible locations. To address the issue of privacy accumulation caused by continuous trajectory queries, we propose a Window-based Adaptive Privacy Budget Allocation (W-APBA), which dynamically allocates privacy budgets to all locations in the current PLS based on their predictability and sensitivity. Finally, we perturb the real location using the allocated privacy budget by the PF (Permute-and-Flip) mechanism, effectively balancing privacy protection and Quality of Service (QoS). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed 3DSTPM effectively reduces QoS loss while meeting the user's personalized privacy protection needs."}

Building on these observations, we introduce the first systematic taxonomy of errors in LLM-generated UML diagrams, categorising structural, relationship, and semantic/logical.

Moreover, existing benchmarks often overlook a critical component of human ToM: behavioral prediction, the ability to use inferred mental states to guide strategic decision-making and select appropriate conversational actions for future interactions. To better align LLM-based ToM evaluation with human-like social reasoning, we propose RecToM, a novel benchmark for evaluating ToM abilities in recommendation dialogues. RecToM focuses on two complementary dimensions: Cognitive Inference and Behavioral Prediction. The former focus on understanding what has been communicated by inferring the underlying mental states. The latter emphasizes what should be done next, evaluating whether LLMs can leverage these inferred mental states to predict, select, and assess appropriate dialogue strategies. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that RecToM poses a significant challenge. While the models exhibit partial competence in recognizing mental states, they struggle to maintain coherent, strategic ToM reasoning throughout dynamic recommendation dialogues, particularly in tracking evolving intentions and aligning conversational strategies with inferred mental states."}

To address this problem, organizations rely on security awareness programs, which aim to make employees more resilient against social engineering. While some works have suggested that such programs should account for contextual relevance, the common praxis in research is to adopt a \"general\" viewpoint. For instance, instead of focusing on department-specific issues, prior user studies sought to provide organization-wide conclusions. Such a protocol may lead to overlooking vulnerabilities that affect only specific subsets of an organization.\n  In this paper, we tackle such an oversight. First, through a systematic literature review, we provide evidence that prior literature poorly accounted for department-specific needs. Then, we carry out a multi-company and mixed-methods study focusing on two pivotal departments: human resources (HR) and accounting. We explore three dimensions: threats faced by these departments; topics covered in the security-awareness campaigns delivered to these departments; and delivery methods that maximize the effectiveness of such campaigns. We begin by interviewing 16 employees of a multinational enterprise, and then use these results as a scaffold to design a structured survey through which we collect the responses of over 90 HR/accounting members of 9 organizations. We find that HR is targeted through job applications containing malware and executive impersonation, while accounting is exposed to invoice fraud, credential theft, and ransomware. Current training is often viewed as too generic, with employees preferring shorter, scenario-based formats like videos and simulations. These preferences contradict the common industry practice of annual sessions. Based on these insights, we propose recommendations for designing awareness programs tailored to departmental needs and workflows."}

Frameworks and standards, such as the Asset Administration Shell (AAS), Eclipse Dataspace Connector (EDC), ID-Link and Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC UA) provide a strong foundation to realize this ecosystem. However, a major open challenge is the practical description and enforcement of context-dependent data usage policies using these base technologies - especially by domain experts without software engineering backgrounds. Therefore, this article proposes a method for leveraging domain-specific languages (DSLs) to enable declarative, human-readable, and machine-executable policy definitions for sovereign data sharing via data space connectors.

This paper presents an AI-assisted workflow that reduces expert involvement in parameter optimization through the use of Bayesian optimization. Furthermore, we present an active learning variant of the approach, assisting the expert if desired. A deep learning model provides an initial parameter estimate, from which the optimization cycle iteratively refines the design until a termination condition (e.g., energy budget or iteration limit) is met. We demonstrate our approach, based on a sheet metal forming process, and show how it enables us to accelerate the exploration of the design space while reducing the need for expert involvement."}

Previous efforts in PGDN classification pursue high accuracy using ideal sample data, while others employ up-to-date data from real-world scenarios but achieve lower classification accuracy. This paper introduces the Real-PGDN method, which accomplishes a complete process of timely and comprehensive real-data crawling, feature extraction with feature-missing tolerance, precise PGDN classification, and assessment of application effects in actual scenarios. Our two-level classifier, which integrates CoSENT (BERT-based), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and traditional classification algorithms, achieves a 97.88% precision.

We define ExtremelyBuggy methods as those involved in more than one bug fix and present the first large-scale study of their prevalence, characteristics, and predictability. Using a dataset of over 1.25 million methods from 98 open-source Java projects, we find that ExtremelyBuggy methods constitute only a tiny fraction of all methods, yet frequently account for a disproportionately large share of bugs. At their inception, these methods are significantly larger, more complex, less readable, and less maintainable than both singly-buggy and non-buggy methods. However, despite these measurable differences, a comprehensive evaluation of five machine learning models shows that early prediction of ExtremelyBuggy methods remains highly unreliable due to data imbalance, project heterogeneity, and the fact that many bugs emerge through subsequent evolution rather than initial implementation. To complement these quantitative findings, we conduct a thematic analysis of 265 ExtremelyBuggy methods, revealing recurring visual issues (e.g., confusing control flow, poor readability), contextual roles (e.g., core logic, data transformation, external resource handling), and common defect patterns (e.g., faulty conditionals, fragile error handling, misuse of variables).

Analogous to how knowledge-informed machine learning improves the reliability of conventional data-driven models, our framework incorporates domain-informed text gradients to guide the generative process toward physically meaningful regions of the DP composition space. Systematic comparison of three incremental configurations, (i) pure LLM generation, (ii) LLM generation with LLM reasoning-based feedback, and (iii) LLM generation with domain knowledge-guided feedback, shows that iterative guidance from knowledge-informed gradients improves stability-condition satisfaction without additional training data, achieving over 98% compositional validity and up to 54% stable or metastable candidates, surpassing both the LLM-only baseline (43%) and prior GAN-based results (27%). Analyses of ML-based gradients further reveal that they enhance performance in in-distribution (ID) regions but become unreliable in out-of-distribution (OOD) regimes. Overall, this work provides the first systematic analysis of multi-agent, knowledge-guided text gradients for DP discovery and establishes a generalizable blueprint for MAS-driven generative materials design aimed at advancing sustainable technologies."}

Among these, a novel paradigm called History Covert Channels (HCC) leverages past network events as reference points to embed covert messages. Unlike traditional timing- or storage-based CCs, which directly manipulate traffic patterns or packet contents, HCCs minimize detectability by encoding information through small pointers to historical data. This approach enables them to amplify the size of transmitted covert data by referring to more bits than are actually embedded. Recent research has explored the feasibility of such methods, demonstrating their potential to evade detection by repurposing naturally occurring network behaviors as a covert transmission medium.\n  This paper introduces a novel method for establishing and maintaining covert communication links using relative pointers to network timing patterns, which minimizes the reliance of the HCC on centralized timekeeping and reduces the likelihood of being detected by standard network monitoring tools. We also explore the tailoring of HCCs to optimize their robustness and undetectability characteristics. Our experiments reveal a better bitrate compared to previous work."}

Mutation-Based Fault Localization (MBFL) has gained prominence due to its robust theoretical foundations and fine-grained analysis capabilities. However, recent studies have identified a critical challenge: noise phenomena, specifically the false kill relationships between mutants and tests, which significantly degrade localization effectiveness. While several approaches have been proposed to rectify the final localization results, they do not directly address the underlying noise. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to refine the kill matrix, a core data structure capturing mutant-test relationships in MBFL, by treating it as a signal that contains both meaningful fault-related patterns and high-frequency noise. Inspired by signal processing theory, we introduce DKMR (Denoising-based Kill Matrix Refinement), which employs two key stages: (1) signal enhancement through hybrid matrix construction to improve the signal-to-noise ratio for better denoising, and (2) signal denoising via frequency domain filtering to suppress noise while preserving fault-related patterns. Building on this foundation, we develop MBFL-DKMR, a fault localization framework that utilizes the refined matrix with fuzzy values for suspiciousness calculation. Our evaluation on Defects4J v2.0.0 demonstrates that MBFL-DKMR effectively mitigates the noise and outperforms the state-of-the-art MBFL techniques. Specifically, MBFL-DKMR achieves 129 faults localized at Top-1 compared to 85 for BLMu and 103 for Delta4Ms, with negligible additional computational overhead (0.11 seconds, 0.001\\% of total time). This work highlights the potential of signal processing techniques to enhance the effectiveness of MBFL by refining the kill matrix."}

Current state-of-the-art generative methods, such as protein language models (PLMs) and diffusion-based architectures, often require extensive fine-tuning, task-specific data, or model reconfiguration to support objective-directed design, thereby limiting their flexibility and scalability. To overcome these limitations, we present a decentralized, agent-based framework inspired by swarm intelligence for de novo protein design. In this approach, multiple large language model (LLM) agents operate in parallel, each assigned to a specific residue position. These agents iteratively propose context-aware mutations by integrating design objectives, local neighborhood interactions, and memory and feedback from previous iterations. This position-wise, decentralized coordination enables emergent design of diverse, well-defined sequences without reliance on motif scaffolds or multiple sequence alignments, validated with experiments on proteins with alpha helix and coil structures. Through analyses of residue conservation, structure-based metrics, and sequence convergence and embeddings, we demonstrate that the framework exhibits emergent behaviors and effective navigation of the protein fitness landscape. Our method achieves efficient, objective-directed designs within a few GPU-hours and operates entirely without fine-tuning or specialized training, offering a generalizable and adaptable solution for protein design. Beyond proteins, the approach lays the groundwork for collective LLM-driven design across biomolecular systems and other scientific discovery tasks."}

Rollups improve transaction throughput by processing operations off-chain and posting the results on-chain. A critical component in Rollups is the Sequencer, responsible for receiving, ordering and batching transactions before they are submitted to the Layer-1 blockchain. While essential, the centralized nature of the Sequencer makes it vulnerable to attacks, such as censorship, transaction manipulation and tampering. To enhance its security, there are solutions in the literature that shield the Sequencer inside a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). However, the attestation of TEEs introduces additional centralization, which is in contrast with the core Blockchain principle. In this paper, we propose a TEE-secured Sequencer equipped with a decentralized attestation mechanism. We outline the design and implementation of our solution, covering the system architecture, TEE integration, and the decentralization of the attestation process.

To address these issues, this paper proposes a Transferable Software Requirement Conflict Detection Framework based on SBERT and SimCSE, termed TSRCDF-SS. First, the framework employs two independent encoders, Sentence-BERT (SBERT) and Simple Contrastive Sentence Embedding (SimCSE), to generate sentence embeddings for requirement pairs, followed by a six-element concatenation strategy. Furthermore, the classifier is enhanced by a two-layer fully connected feedforward neural network (FFNN) with a hybrid loss optimization strategy that integrates a variant of Focal Loss, domain-specific constraints, and a confidence-based penalty term. Finally, the framework synergistically integrates sequential and cross-domain transfer learning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves a 10.4% improvement in both macro-F1 and weighted-F1 scores in in-domain settings, and an 11.4% increase in macro-F1 in cross-domain scenarios."}

Traditional approaches relying on static city-level aggregates fail to capture a fundamental dynamic: the developmental trajectory of one city today may mirror that of its structurally similar counterparts tomorrow. ECO-GROW overcomes this limitation by integrating industrial linkages, POI similarities, migration similarities and temporal network evolution over 15 years. The framework combines a Dynamic Top-K GCN to adaptively select influential inter-city connections and an adaptive Graph Scorer mechanism to dynamically weight cross-regional impacts. Additionally, the model incorporates a link prediction task based on Barabasi Proximity, optimizing the graph representation. Experimental results demonstrate ECO-GROW's superior accuracy in predicting entrepreneurial activities and employment trends compared to conventional models.

We begin by showing that, despite this limitation, minimal revision is still a successful learning method in a wide range of situations. Firstly, it can learn any problem that is finitely identifiable. Secondly, it can learn with positive and negative data, as long as one considers finitely many possibilities. We then characterize the prior plausibility assignments (over finitely many possibilities) that enable one to learn via minimal revision, and do the same for conditioning and lexicographic upgrade.

We also incorporate optical character recognition (OCR) for textual enrichment and evaluate the generated element lists against ground truth data derived from the source XML files. Our approach enables robust component extraction in scenarios where original source files are unavailable. We benchmark multiple VLMs and observe performance improvements in several models when OCR is used for text enrichment. In addition, we conducted extensive statistical analyses of OCR-based enrichment methods and prompt ablation studies, providing a clearer understanding of their impact on model performance."}

To date, several approaches have been proposed based on the Residue Number System variant of the Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (RNS-CKKS) scheme. However, they all suffer from high latency, which severely limits the applications in real-world tasks. Currently, the research on encrypted inference in deep CNNs confronts three main bottlenecks: i) the time and storage costs of convolution calculation; ii) the time overhead of huge bootstrapping operations; and iii) the consumption of circuit multiplication depth. Towards these three challenges, we in this paper propose an efficient and effective mechanism FastFHE to accelerate the model inference while simultaneously retaining high inference accuracy over fully homomorphic encryption. Concretely, our work elaborates four unique novelties. First, we propose a new scalable ciphertext data-packing scheme to save the time and storage consumptions. Second, we work out a depthwise-separable convolution fashion to degrade the computation load of convolution calculation. Third, we figure out a BN dot-product fusion matrix to merge the ciphertext convolutional layer with the batch-normalization layer without incurring extra multiplicative depth. Last but not least, we adopt the low-degree Legendre polynomial to approximate the nonlinear smooth activation function SiLU under the guarantee of tiny accuracy error before and after encrypted inference. Finally, we execute multi-facet experiments to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed approach."}

It follows a procedure with four steps that adaptively selects strategies based on image difficulty and is equipped with specialized tools such as visual reverse search, which emulates how humans gather external geographic clues. Experimental results show that GEO-Detective outperforms baseline large vision language models (LVLMs) overall, particularly on images lacking visible geographic features. In country level geolocation tasks, it achieves an improvement of over 11.1% compared to baseline LLMs, and even at finer grained levels, it still provides around a 5.2% performance gain. Meanwhile, when equipped with external clues, GEO-Detective becomes more likely to produce accurate predictions, reducing the \"unknown\" prediction rate by more than 50.6%. We further explore multiple defense strategies and find that Geo-Detective exhibits stronger robustness, highlighting the need for more effective privacy safeguards."}

Despite notable advancements in GUI testing and static call graph construction, current tools are insufficient for reliably driving execution toward specific target methods, especially those not embedded in a graphical component (e.g., libraries' methods), a capability essential for tasks such as vulnerability validation, debugging, and behavioral analysis.\n  We present GAPS (Graph-based Automated Path Synthesizer), the first system that integrates static, method-guided call graph analysis with dynamic, interaction-driven execution. GAPS performs a lightweight backward traversal of the call graph, guided by data-flow analysis, to reconstruct paths reaching the target methods.

Across multiple datasets and query structures, we find several cases where neural and relaxation-based approaches perform similarly, with no neural model consistently outperforming the latter. Moreover, a similarity analysis reveals that their retrieved answers exhibit little overlap, and that combining their outputs consistently improves performance. These results call for a re-evaluation of progress in neural query answering: despite their complexity, current models fail to subsume the reasoning patterns captured by query relaxation.

With the emergence of innovative defensive solutions that place system- and algorithm-level checks and corrections in the input and weight spaces, these perturbations are increasingly susceptible to defenses. This work develops a novel perspective on Trojan attacks that generates an attacker-designed model output while leaving no attack traces on the inputs or weights. Such an attack space can be unlocked through corruption of the key-value (KV) cache. In this paper, we introduce CacheTrap, a novel Trojan attack that corrupts the value vectors stored in the KV cache. These vectors capture the dynamic activations for specific token positions and therefore constitute a natural surface for transient, inference-time trigger insertion. The transient nature of these KV values and their dependence on victim input imply additional constraints on our attack, such as a lack of knowledge of the victim's data or domain application, and, consequently, a lack of gradient information. The objective of the proposed CacheTrap is to develop a vulnerable KV bit-searching algorithm so that, once the attack employs the identified bit-flip as a trigger, the model generates targeted behavior, e.g., classifying inputs towards the target class. Moreover, CacheTrap is a data- and gradient-free attack which also has no impact on the model's utility. Our evaluation demonstrates that the proposed attack enables the first successful Trojan attack on LLMs with a single bit flip in the KV cache. In addition, the data-independent nature of the attack ensures that once the attacker identifies the vulnerable bit index, the location remains constant and can be transferred to a wide range of victim tasks/datasets/queries with no overhead."}

However, MBFL faces significant challenges due to interference mutants generated from non-faulty code entities but can be killed by failing tests. These mutants mimic the test sensitivity behaviors of real faulty code entities and weaken the effectiveness of fault localization. To address this challenge, we introduce the concept of Fault Localization Interference Mutants (FLIMs) and conduct a theoretical analysis based on the Reachability, Infection, Propagation, and Revealability (RIPR) model, identifying four distinct interference causes. Building on this, we propose a novel approach to semantically recognize and mitigate FLIMs using LLM-based semantic analysis, enhanced by fine-tuning techniques and confidence estimation strategies to address LLM output instability. The recognized FLIMs are then mitigated by refining the suspiciousness scores calculated from MBFL techniques. We integrate FLIM recognition and mitigation into the MBFL workflow, developing MBFL-FLIM, a fault localization framework that enhances MBFL's effectiveness by reducing misleading interference while preserving real fault-revealing information. Our empirical experiments on the Defects4J benchmark with 395 program versions using eight LLMs demonstrate MBFL-FLIM's superiority over traditional SBFL and MBFL methods, advanced dynamic feature-based approaches, and recent LLM-based fault localization techniques. Specifically, MBFL-FLIM achieves an average improvement of 44 faults in the Top-1 metric, representing a significant enhancement over baseline methods. Further evaluation confirms MBFL-FLIM's robust performance in multi-fault scenarios, with ablation experiments validating the contributions of the fine-tuning and confidence estimation components."}

By scaling reasoning with reinforcement learning that rewards correct final answers, LLMs have improved from poor performance to saturating quantitative reasoning competitions like AIME and HMMT in one year. However, this approach faces fundamental limitations. Pursuing higher final answer accuracy doesn't address a key issue: correct answers don't guarantee correct reasoning. Moreover, many mathematical tasks like theorem proving require rigorous step-by-step derivation rather than numerical answers, making final answer rewards inapplicable. To push the limits of deep reasoning, we believe it is necessary to verify the comprehensiveness and rigor of mathematical reasoning. Self-verification is particularly important for scaling test-time compute, especially for open problems without known solutions. Towards self-verifiable mathematical reasoning, we investigate how to train an accurate and faithful LLM-based verifier for theorem proving. We then train a proof generator using the verifier as the reward model, and incentivize the generator to identify and resolve as many issues as possible in their own proofs before finalizing them. To maintain the generation-verification gap as the generator becomes stronger, we propose to scale verification compute to automatically label new hard-to-verify proofs, creating training data to further improve the verifier. Our resulting model, DeepSeekMath-V2, demonstrates strong theorem-proving capabilities, achieving gold-level scores on IMO 2025 and CMO 2024 and a near-perfect 118/120 on Putnam 2024 with scaled test-time compute."}

This growing adoption underscores the need to ensure their security and robustness. In this work, we focus on the impact of Bit Flip Attacks (BFAs) on LLMs, which exploits hardware faults to corrupt model parameters, posing a significant threat to model integrity and performance. Existing studies on BFA against LLMs adopt a progressive bit-search strategy that predominantly relies on gradient-based techniques to identify sensitive layers or weights. However, computing gradients comes with two specific challenges: First, in the context of LLMs, it increases computational and memory costs exponentially, and Second, it requires access to a sample victim dataset or knowledge of the victim domain to compute the gradient. In this work, we investigate beyond the scope of attack efficacy and aim to develop an efficient, practical Gradient-Data-free Bit-Flip Attack. The challenge lies in the core principle of adversarial attacks, which relies heavily on computing gradients from sample test/train data and manipulating model weights based on gradient information. To overcome this, we propose novel vulnerability index metrics that can identify vulnerable weight bits in LLMs independent of any gradient or data knowledge. By removing the dependency on gradient computation, our approach drastically reduces memory requirements and scales efficiently across multiple tasks with constant complexity. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of our method, requiring as few as a single bit flip to achieve adversarial objectives for five open-source LLMs."}

While recent Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) improve chart representation, existing approaches still struggle to achieve cross-type generalization, memory efficiency, and modular design. To address these challenges, this paper proposes C2C-MoLA, a multimodal framework that synergizes Mixture of Experts (MoE) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). The MoE component uses a complexity-aware routing mechanism with domain-specialized experts and load-balanced sparse gating, dynamically allocating inputs based on learnable structural metrics like element count and chart complexity. LoRA enables parameter-efficient updates for resource-conscious tuning, further supported by a tailored training strategy that aligns routing stability with semantic accuracy. Experiments on Chart2Code-160k show that the proposed model improves generation accuracy by up to 17%, reduces peak GPU memory by 18%, and accelerates convergence by 20%, when compared to standard fine-tuning and LoRA-only baselines, particularly on complex charts. Ablation studies validate optimal designs, such as 8 experts and rank-8 LoRA, and confirm scalability for real-world multimodal code generation."}

AI deception, in which systems induce false beliefs to secure self-beneficial outcomes, has evolved from a speculative concern to an empirically demonstrated risk across language models, AI agents, and emerging frontier systems. This project provides a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the AI deception field, covering its core concepts, methodologies, genesis, and potential mitigations. First, we identify a formal definition of AI deception, grounded in signaling theory from studies of animal deception. We then review existing empirical studies and associated risks, highlighting deception as a sociotechnical safety challenge. We organize the landscape of AI deception research as a deception cycle, consisting of two key components: deception emergence and deception treatment. Deception emergence reveals the mechanisms underlying AI deception: systems with sufficient capability and incentive potential inevitably engage in deceptive behaviors when triggered by external conditions. Deception treatment, in turn, focuses on detecting and addressing such behaviors. On deception emergence, we analyze incentive foundations across three hierarchical levels and identify three essential capability preconditions required for deception. We further examine contextual triggers, including supervision gaps, distributional shifts, and environmental pressures. On deception treatment, we conclude detection methods covering benchmarks and evaluation protocols in static and interactive settings. Building on the three core factors of deception emergence, we outline potential mitigation strategies and propose auditing approaches that integrate technical, community, and governance efforts to address sociotechnical challenges and future AI risks.

This is the arXiv preprint version", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, but incur high communication overhead and privacy risks in cloud deployments, while facing compute and memory constraints when confined to edge devices. Cloud-edge inference has emerged as a promising paradigm for improving privacy in LLM services by retaining sensitive computations on local devices. However, existing cloud-edge inference approaches apply uniform privacy protection without considering input sensitivity, resulting in unnecessary perturbation and degraded utility even for non-sensitive tokens. To address this limitation, we propose Privacy-aware Routing for Inference with Semantic Modulation (PRISM), a context-aware framework that dynamically balances privacy and inference quality. PRISM executes in four stages: (1) the edge device profiles entity-level sensitivity; (2) a soft gating module on the edge selects an execution mode - cloud, edge, or collaboration; (3) for collaborative paths, the edge applies adaptive two-layer local differential privacy based on entity risks; and (4) the cloud LLM generates a semantic sketch from the perturbed prompt, which is then refined by the edge-side small language model (SLM) using local context. Our results show that PRISM consistently achieves superior privacy-utility trade-offs across various scenarios, reducing energy consumption and latency to 40-50% of baseline methods such as Uniform and Selective LDP, while maintaining high output quality under strong privacy constraints. These findings are validated through comprehensive evaluations involving realistic prompts, actual energy measurements, and heterogeneous cloud-edge model deployments."}

Current paradigms fail to bridge this gap. Training-based methods suffer from an ``oracle paradox,'' learning flawed spatial logic from imperfect oracles. Tool-integrated methods constrain the final computation but critically leave the VLM's planning process unconstrained, resulting in geometrically flawed plans. In this work, we propose Geometrically-Constrained Agent (GCA), a training-free agentic paradigm that resolves this gap by introducing a formal task constraint. Specifically, we strategically decouples the VLM's role into two stages. First, acting as a semantic analyst, the VLM translates the user's ambiguous query into the formal, verifiable task constraint, which defines the reference frame and objective. Second, acting as a task solver, the VLM generates and executes tool calls strictly within the deterministic bounds defined by the constraint. This geometrically-constrained reasoning strategy successfully resolve the semantic-to-geometric gap, yielding a robust and verifiable reasoning pathway for spatial reasoning.

For this reason, security-oriented disciplines of signal processing have received increasing attention in the last decades: multimedia forensics, digital watermarking, biometrics, network monitoring, steganography and steganalysis are just a few examples. Even though each of these fields has its own peculiarities, they all have to deal with a common problem: the presence of one or more adversaries aiming at making the system fail. Adversarial Signal Processing lays the basis of a general theory that takes into account the impact that the presence of an adversary has on the design of effective signal processing tools. By focusing on the application side of Adversarial Signal Processing, namely adversarial information fusion in distributed sensor networks, and adopting a game-theoretic approach, this thesis contributes to the above mission by addressing four issues. First, we address decision fusion in distributed sensor networks by developing a novel soft isolation defense scheme that protect the network from adversaries, specifically, Byzantines. Second, we develop an optimum decision fusion strategy in the presence of Byzantines. In the next step, we propose a technique to reduce the complexity of the optimum fusion by relying on a novel near-optimum message passing algorithm based on factor graphs. Finally, we introduce a defense mechanism to protect decentralized networks running consensus algorithm against data falsification attacks."}

However, large tool outputs can overflow the LLMs' context window, preventing task completion. Existing solutions such as truncation or summarization fail to preserve complete outputs, making them unsuitable for workflows requiring the full data. This work introduces a method that enables LLMs to process and utilize tool responses of arbitrary length without loss of information. By shifting the model's interaction from raw data to memory pointers, the method preserves tool functionality, allows seamless integration into agentic workflows, and reduces token usage and execution time. The proposed method is validated on a real-world Materials Science application that cannot be executed with conventional workflows, and its effectiveness is demonstrated via a comparative analysis where both methods succeed. In this experiment, the proposed approach consumed approximately seven times fewer tokens than the traditional workflow."}

Proactive detection of cyber threats has become essential to help security teams identify potential risks and implement effective mitigation measures. Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) plays a key role by providing security analysts with evidence-based knowledge about cyber threats. CTI information can be extracted using various techniques and data sources; however, machine learning has proven promising. As for data sources, social networks and online discussion forums are commonly explored. In this study, we apply text mining techniques and machine learning to data collected from Dark Web forums in Brazilian Portuguese to identify malicious posts. Our contributions include the creation of three original datasets, a novel multi-stage labeling process combining indicators of compromise (IoCs), contextual keywords, and manual analysis, and a comprehensive evaluation of text representations and classifiers. To our knowledge, this is the first study to focus specifically on Brazilian Portuguese content in this domain. The best-performing model, using LightGBM and TF-IDF, was able to detect relevant posts with high accuracy. We also applied topic modeling to validate the model's outputs on unlabeled data, confirming its robustness in real-world scenarios."}

The system will use a multi-layer structure; it will include an Application and Interface Layer, an Agents Layer, and a Data Source Layer to provide adaptive, transparent, and inclusive support. Fundamentally, a hybrid reasoning engine will synchronize four special-purpose agents, which include: a personalized-nutrition-based, called a Meal Planner Agent; an adaptive-scheduling-based, called a Reminder Agent; interactive assistance during grocery shopping and cooking, called a Food Guidance Agent; and a continuous-intake-and-physiological-tracking, called a Monitoring Agent. All the agents interact through a central communicative system called the Blackboard/Event Bus, which allows autonomous interaction and real-time feedback loops with multimedia user interfaces. Privacy-sensitive data sources, including electronic health records (EHRs), nutritional databases, wearable sensors, and smart kitchen Internet of Things, are also included in the framework and placed into a policy-controlled layer, which ensures data safety and compliance with consent. Collaborative care and clinician dashboards allow common supervision, and discussable artificial intelligence (XAI) modules give brief explanations of why a decision was made, making users responsible and reliant. The proposed agentic AI framework is an extension beyond traditional assistive systems since it incorporates inclusiveness, personalization, and accessibility at all levels. It displays the intersection of multi-agent reasoning, multi-modal interfaces, and human-centered design that will enable the development of autonomy, health, and digital equity among people with disabilities and neurodivergence."}

Malware experts seek to categorize and classify incoming samples to confirm their trustworthiness or prove their maliciousness. One of the ways in which groups of malware samples can be identified is through malware clustering. Despite the efforts of the community, malware clustering which incorporates benign samples has been under-explored. Moreover, despite the availability of larger public benchmark malware datasets, malware clustering studies have avoided fully utilizing these datasets in their experiments, often resorting to small datasets with only a few families. Additionally, the current state-of-the-art solutions for malware clustering remain unclear. In our study, we evaluate malware clustering quality and establish the state-of-the-art on Bodmas and Ember - two large public benchmark malware datasets. Ours is the first study of malware clustering performed on whole malware benchmark datasets. Additionally, we extend the malware clustering task by incorporating benign samples. Our results indicate that incorporating benign samples does not significantly degrade clustering quality. We find that there are significant differences in the quality of the created clusters between Ember and Bodmas, as well as a private industry dataset. Contrary to popular opinion, our top clustering performers are K-Means and BIRCH, with DBSCAN and HAC falling behind."}

The paper outlines an agentic artificial intelligence system to study atmospheric water-cycle intelligence, which combines sensing, forecasting, downscaling, hydrological modeling and coordinated response into a single, interconnected, priceless, closed-loop system. The framework uses autonomous but cooperative agents that reason, sense, and act throughout the entire event lifecycle, and use the intelligence of weather prediction to become real-time decision intelligence. Comparison of multi-year radar, satellite, and ground-based evaluation of the northern part of Pakistan demonstrates that the multi-agent configuration enhances forecast reliability, critical success index and warning lead time compared to the baseline models. Population reach was maximised, and errors during evacuation were minimised through communication and routing agents, and adaptive recalibration and transparent auditability were provided by the embedded layer of learning. Collectively, this leads to the conclusion that collaborative AI agents are capable of transforming atmospheric data streams into practicable foresight and provide a platform of scalable adaptive and learning-based climate resilience."}

Traditional similarity measures ignore the dynamical processes underlying neural representations. Dynamical similarity methods offer a framework to compare the temporal structure of dynamical systems by embedding their (possibly) nonlinear dynamics into a globally linear space and there computing conjugacy metrics. However, identifying the best embedding and computing these metrics can be computationally slow. Here we introduce fast Dynamical Similarity Analysis (fastDSA), which is computationally far more efficient than previous methods while maintaining their accuracy and robustness. FastDSA introduces two key components that boost efficiency: (1) automatic selection of the effective model order of the Hankel (delay) embedding from the data via a data-driven singular-value threshold that identifies the informative subspace and discards noise to lower computational cost without sacrificing signal, and (2) a novel optimization procedure and objective, which replaces the slow exact orthogonality constraint in finding a minimal distance between dynamics matrices with a lightweight process to keep the search close to the space of orthogonal transformations. We demonstrate that fastDSA is at least an order of magnitude faster than the previous methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fastDSA has the properties of its ancestor, including its invariances and sensitivities to system dynamics. FastDSA, therefore, provides a computationally efficient and accurate method for dynamical similarity analysis."}

This challenge is magnified in Internet of Things (IoT) environments, where devices face stringent bandwidth, latency, and energy constraints. Conventional secure aggregation protocols, while essential for protecting model updates, frequently require multiple interaction rounds, large payload sizes, and per-client costs rendering them impractical for many edge deployments.\n  In this work, we present Hyb-Agg, a lightweight and communication-efficient secure aggregation protocol that integrates Multi-Key CKKS (MK-CKKS) homomorphic encryption with Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)-based additive masking. Hyb-Agg reduces the secure aggregation process to a single, non-interactive client-to-server transmission per round, ensuring that per-client communication remains constant regardless of the number of participants. This design eliminates partial decryption exchanges, preserves strong privacy under the RLWE, CDH, and random oracle assumptions, and maintains robustness against collusion by the server and up to $N-2$ clients.\n  We implement and evaluate Hyb-Agg on both high-performance and resource-constrained devices, including a Raspberry Pi 4, demonstrating that it delivers sub-second execution times while achieving a constant communication expansion factor of approximately 12x over plaintext size. By directly addressing the communication bottleneck, Hyb-Agg enables scalable, privacy-preserving federated learning that is practical for real-world IoT deployments."}

Existing exact unlearning methods typically require frequent retraining from scratch, resulting in high communication cost and long service downtime. To address this, we propose Federated Sequential Group-based Training (FedSGT), an exact unlearning framework for FL. FedSGT partitions the data into uniform groups, and each client may participate in multiple groups. To control communication overhead, each client can limit the number of groups it contributes to. FedSGT then trains multiple sequences of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) modules, each corresponding to a different group permutation. Since the PEFT modules are lightweight and maintained server-side, FedSGT isolates the influence of different data groups into independent modules without incurring significant storage overhead and communication cost. Exact unlearning is thus achieved instantly by deactivating the modules corresponding to the group containing the unlearned data. Furthermore, using multiple training sequences helps maintain high model utility as deletion requests accumulate. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of both the deletion rate -- expected number of deletions before retraining is needed -- and the expected model performance. Experiments on various tasks demonstrate that FedSGT achieves a significantly longer service maintenance under multiple unlearning requests while maintaining comparable learning performance and training efficiency to other exact unlearning baselines. Extensive ablation studies validate the robustness of our method across a wide range of parameter settings."}

Inspired by the Language of Thought Hypothesis, which posits that human reasoning operates over a symbolic, compositional mental language called Mentalese, we introduce a framework that trains models to reason in a similarly compact style. Mentalese encodes abstract reasoning as ultra-compressed, structured tokens, enabling models to solve complex problems with far fewer steps. To improve both efficiency and accuracy, we propose SHORTER LENGTH PREFERENCE OPTIMIZATION (SLPO), a reinforcement learning method that rewards concise solutions that stay correct, while still allowing longer reasoning when needed. Applied to Mentalese-aligned models, SLPO yields significantly higher compression rates by enabling concise reasoning that preserves the benefits of detailed thinking without the computational overhead. Across benchmarks including AIME 2024 and 2025, MinervaMath, OlympiadBench, Math500, and AMC, our ORION models produce reasoning traces with 4-16x fewer tokens, achieve up to 5x lower inference latency, and reduce training costs by 7-9x relative to the DeepSeek R1 Distilled model, while maintaining 90-98% of its accuracy. ORION also surpasses Claude and ChatGPT-4o by up to 5% in accuracy while maintaining 2x compression. These results show that Mentalese-style compressed reasoning offers a step toward human-like cognitive efficiency, enabling real-time, cost-effective reasoning without sacrificing accuracy."}

Our evaluation employs Proof-of-Vulnerability (PoV) test execution to concretely assess whether LLM-generated source code successfully patches vulnerabilities. Our results reveal that LLMs patch real vulnerabilities more effectively compared to artificial ones. Additionally, our analysis reveals significant variability across LLMs in terms of overlapping (multiple LLMs patching the same vulnerabilities) and complementarity (vulnerabilities patched exclusively by a single LLM), emphasizing the importance of selecting appropriate LLMs for effective vulnerability patching."}

To bridge this gap, we introduce TIM-PRM (Tool-Integrated Multimodal PRM), a novel agentic framework that transforms verification from a passive classification task into an active, tool-augmented investigation. TIM-PRM is trained to explicitly plan verification strategies and utilizes a mechanism of Independent Question Asking to query evidence via external tools, effectively decoupling verification from the reasoning context to eliminate confirmation bias. We instantiate this method by curating a high-quality dataset of tool-integrated verification trajectories.

To address this, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), specifically Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Deep Q-Networks (DQN), is combined with community/distributed P2P trading mechanisms. By incorporating auction-based market clearing, a price advisor agent, and load and battery management, the approach achieves significant improvements. Results show that, compared to baseline models, DQN reduces electricity costs by 14.2% in Ireland and 5.16% in Finland, while increasing electricity revenue by 7.24% and 12.73%, respectively. PPO achieves the lowest peak hour demand, reducing it by 55.5% in Ireland, while DQN reduces peak hour demand by 50.0% in Ireland and 27.02% in Finland. These improvements are attributed to both MARL algorithms and P2P energy trading, which together results in electricity cost and peak hour demand reduction, and increase electricity selling revenue.

To address this gap, we introduce AgriCoT, a VQA dataset that incorporates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, specifically designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of VLMs. With 4,535 carefully curated samples, AgriCoT offers a comprehensive and robust evaluation of reasoning abilities for VLMs, particularly in zero-shot scenarios, by focusing on their capacity to engage in logical reasoning and effective problem-solving. Our evaluations, conducted with 26 representative VLMs, including both proprietary and open-source models, reveal that while some proprietary models excel at answering questions, there is a notable and significant gap in their reasoning capabilities. This underscores the importance of incorporating CoT for more precise and effective assessments. Our dataset are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/wenyb/AgriCoT."}

In contrast, humans leverage the metacognitive model with memory, enabling continuous strategy refinement through metacognitive control when faced with new challenges. To bridge this gap, we propose metacognitive test-time reasoning (MCTR), a framework that equips models with the ability to learn, adapt, and improve during test time through metacognitive self-updating. Inspired by the dual structure of human metacognition, MCTR comprises meta-level and object-level VLM reasoning modules, each equipped with dedicated memory systems for hierarchical adaptive reasoning. Specifically, MCTR consists of (1) a meta-reasoning module which incrementally builds a structured memory by discovering and storing task-relevant rules, environmental patterns, and action-outcome relationships from test-time observations as natural language descriptions; and (2) an action-reasoning module that determines optimal actions through context-aware perception and strategic reasoning by dynamically retrieving and integrating knowledge from memory. The action-reasoning module continuously updates its policy through proposed metacognitive test-time reinforcement learning, adapting as knowledge memory evolves. We evaluate MCTR on 45 Atari games (33 seen, 12 unseen). MCTR demonstrates robust test-time adaptation, achieving 9/12 top-1 results on unseen games compared with baselines. Analyses through ablations, learning dynamics, and case studies reveal the complementary contributions of both components and show meta-reasoning evolving toward human-like adaptation strategies."}

Existing methods fail to capture the structural information within video, and suffer from insufficient fine-grained modeling of multi-modal features. To address these issues, we are the first to introduce a new multi-modal scene graph that explicitly models the objects and their relationship as a visually grounded, structured representation of the audio-visual scene.

This enables more fine-grained modeling of cross-modal interactions within the question-aware fused audio-visual representation, leading to capture richer and more nuanced patterns and then improve temporal reasoning performance. We evaluate the model on the established MUSIC-AVQA and MUSIC-AVQA v2 benchmarks, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code and model checkpoints will be publicly released."}

Unlike conventional supervised fine-tuning, SuperIntelliAgent learns autonomously without annotation: the learner generates candidate outputs, the verifier evaluates them through step-by-step reasoning, and their interaction produces chosen/rejected pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This converts each input into a pseudo-training signal for continual improvement. The framework integrates dual-scale memory: short-term in-context memory that preserves reasoning traces across refinement cycles, and long-term memory that consolidates acquired knowledge through lightweight on-the-fly fine-tuning. A replay buffer retains samples that show verifiable progress and replays them as auxiliary supervision, reinforcing recent learning while forming adaptive curricula. SuperIntelliAgent is infrastructure-agnostic and can be plugged into existing agentic frameworks while turning ordinary inference loops into a lifelong optimization process. We posit that pairing a trainable learner with a reasoning-capable verifier forms a minimal reliable unit of growing intelligence, as paired feedback and partial-history replay yield richer learning curricula and stronger preference alignment. With a small number of automatically generated DPO pairs, the learner improves across all benchmarks, indicating that this mechanism provides a promising direction for continual intelligence accumulation and real-world deployment."}

While multi-turn interaction offers a superior understanding of environmental dynamics via authentic feedback, current approaches often impose a rigid reasoning process, which constrains the model's active learning, ultimately hindering efficient world model reasoning. To address these issues, we explore world-model internalization through efficient interaction and active reasoning (WMAct), which liberates the model from structured reasoning, allowing the model to shape thinking directly through its doing, and achieves effective and efficient world model reasoning with two key mechanisms: (1) a reward rescaling mechanism adjusting outcome reward based on action efficacy to incentivize redundancy reduction and purposeful interaction; (2) an interaction frequency annealing strategy to progressively reduce the maximum allowed interaction turns, which compels the model to condense its learning and internalize environmental dynamics rather than over-relying on environmental cues. Our experiments on Sokoban, Maze, and Taxi show that WMAct yields effective world model reasoning capable of resolving tasks in a single turn that previously required multiple interactions and fosters strong transferability to complex environments, improving performance on a suite of reasoning benchmarks."}

Although traditional web and mobile policies are well studied, the privacy policies of LLM providers, their LLM-specific content, and their evolution over time remain largely underexplored. In this paper, we present the first longitudinal empirical study of privacy policies for mainstream LLM providers worldwide. We curate a chronological dataset of 74 historical privacy policies and 115 supplemental privacy documents from 11 LLM providers across 5 countries up to August 2025, and extract over 3,000 sentence-level edits between consecutive policy versions. We compare LLM privacy policies to those of other software formats, propose a taxonomy tailored to LLM privacy policies, annotate policy edits and align them with a timeline of key LLM ecosystem events. Results show they are substantially longer, demand college-level reading ability, and remain highly vague. Our taxonomy analysis reveals patterns in how providers disclose LLM-specific practices and highlights regional disparities in coverage. Policy edits are concentrated in first-party data collection and international/specific-audience sections, and that product releases and regulatory actions are the primary drivers, shedding light on the status quo and the evolution of LLM privacy policies."}

A significant \"language barrier\" currently separates technical security teams, who focus on algorithmic vulnerabilities (e.g., MITRE ATLAS), from legal and compliance professionals, who address regulatory mandates (e.g., EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF). This disciplinary disconnect prevents the accurate translation of technical vulnerabilities into financial liability, leaving practitioners unable to answer fundamental economic questions regarding contingency reserves, control return-on-investment, and insurance exposure. To bridge this gap, this research presents the AI System Threat Vector Taxonomy, a structured ontology designed explicitly for Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA). The framework categorizes AI-specific risks into nine critical domains: Misuse, Poisoning, Privacy, Adversarial, Biases, Unreliable Outputs, Drift, Supply Chain, and IP Threat, integrating 53 operationally defined sub-threats. Uniquely, each domain maps technical vectors directly to business loss categories (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, Legal, Reputation), enabling the translation of abstract threats into measurable financial impact. The taxonomy is empirically validated through an analysis of 133 documented AI incidents from 2025 (achieving 100% classification coverage) and reconciled against the main AI risk frameworks. Furthermore, it is explicitly aligned with ISO/IEC 42001 controls and NIST AI RMF functions to facilitate auditability."}

However, many domain scientists lack the programming expertise required to develop custom data analysis workflows, creating barriers to timely and effective insight. Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising solution by generating executable code from natural language descriptions. In this paper, we investigate the trustworthiness of open-source LLMs in autonomously producing Python scripts for scientific data analysis and visualization. We construct a benchmark suite of domain-inspired prompts that reflect real-world research tasks and systematically evaluate the executability and correctness of the generated code. Our findings show that, without human intervention, the reliability of LLM-generated code is limited, with frequent failures caused by ambiguous prompts and the models' insufficient understanding of domain-specific contexts. To address these challenges, we design and assess three complementary strategies: data-aware prompt disambiguation, retrieval-augmented prompt enhancement, and iterative error repair. While these methods significantly improve execution success rates and output quality, further refinement is needed. This work highlights both the promise and current limitations of LLM-driven automation in scientific workflows and introduces actionable techniques and a reusable benchmark for building more inclusive, accessible, and trustworthy AI-assisted research tools."}

To date, several approaches have been proposed based on the Residue Number System variant of the Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (RNS-CKKS) scheme. However, they all suffer from high latency, which severely limits the applications in real-world tasks. Currently, the research on encrypted inference in deep CNNs confronts three main bottlenecks: i) the time and storage costs of convolution calculation; ii) the time overhead of huge bootstrapping operations; and iii) the consumption of circuit multiplication depth. Towards these three challenges, we in this paper propose an efficient and effective mechanism FastFHE to accelerate the model inference while simultaneously retaining high inference accuracy over fully homomorphic encryption. Concretely, our work elaborates four unique novelties. First, we propose a new scalable ciphertext data-packing scheme to save the time and storage consumptions. Second, we work out a depthwise-separable convolution fashion to degrade the computation load of convolution calculation. Third, we figure out a BN dot-product fusion matrix to merge the ciphertext convolutional layer with the batch-normalization layer without incurring extra multiplicative depth. Last but not least, we adopt the low-degree Legendre polynomial to approximate the nonlinear smooth activation function SiLU under the guarantee of tiny accuracy error before and after encrypted inference.

Experimental results show that GEO-Detective outperforms baseline large vision language models (LVLMs) overall, particularly on images lacking visible geographic features.

To address these issues, this paper proposes a Transferable Software Requirement Conflict Detection Framework based on SBERT and SimCSE, termed TSRCDF-SS. First, the framework employs two independent encoders, Sentence-BERT (SBERT) and Simple Contrastive Sentence Embedding (SimCSE), to generate sentence embeddings for requirement pairs, followed by a six-element concatenation strategy. Furthermore, the classifier is enhanced by a two-layer fully connected feedforward neural network (FFNN) with a hybrid loss optimization strategy that integrates a variant of Focal Loss, domain-specific constraints, and a confidence-based penalty term.

Hyb-Agg reduces the secure aggregation process to a single, non-interactive client-to-server transmission per round, ensuring that per-client communication remains constant regardless of the number of participants.

Our evaluation employs Proof-of-Vulnerability (PoV) test execution to concretely assess whether LLM-generated source code successfully patches vulnerabilities. Our results reveal that LLMs patch real vulnerabilities more effectively compared to artificial ones. Additionally, our analysis reveals significant variability across LLMs in terms of overlapping (multiple LLMs patching the same vulnerabilities) and complementarity (vulnerabilities patched exclusively by a single LLM), emphasizing the importance of selecting appropriate LLMs for effective vulnerability patching."}
