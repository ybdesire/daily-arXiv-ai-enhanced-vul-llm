Although automating scientific tasks with large language models (LLMs) has attracted attention, applying them to the complete, end-to-end CFD workflow remains a challenge due to its stringent domain-specific requirements. We introduce CFD-copilot, a domain-specialized LLM framework designed to facilitate natural language-driven CFD simulation from setup to post-processing. The framework employs a fine-tuned LLM to directly translate user descriptions into executable CFD setups. A multi-agent system integrates the LLM with simulation execution, automatic error correction, and result analysis. For post-processing, the framework utilizes the model context protocol (MCP), an open standard that decouples LLM reasoning from external tool execution. This modular design allows the LLM to interact with numerous specialized post-processing functions through a unified and scalable interface, improving the automation of data extraction and analysis. The framework was evaluated on benchmarks including the NACA~0012 airfoil and the three-element 30P-30N airfoil. The results indicate that domain-specific adaptation and the incorporation of the MCP jointly enhance the reliability and efficiency of LLM-driven engineering workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "CFD-copilot\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u7528\u4e8eCFD\u4eff\u771f\u7684LLM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5230\u540e\u5904\u7406\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aefCFD\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "CFD\u4eff\u771f\u914d\u7f6e\u9700\u8981\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u975e\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u58eb\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e86\u969c\u788d\u3002\u5f53\u524dLLM\u5728\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aefCFD\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5fae\u8c03LLM\u76f4\u63a5\u5c06\u7528\u6237\u63cf\u8ff0\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u53ef\u6267\u884cCFD\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u96c6\u6210\u4eff\u771f\u6267\u884c\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u9519\u8bef\u6821\u6b63\u548c\u7ed3\u679c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u540e\u5904\u7406\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u534f\u8bae\u5b9e\u73b0LLM\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u5206\u79bb\u3002", "result": "\u5728NACA 0012\u7ffc\u578b\u548c30P-30N\u4e09\u5143\u7d20\u7ffc\u578b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u9002\u5e94\u548cMCP\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u5de5\u7a0b\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u5f15\u5165\u5171\u540c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u5de5\u7a0b\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u975e\u4e13\u5bb6\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6613\u7528\u7684CFD\u4eff\u771f\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We define semantic preservation in LESS as the property that optimizations of intelligent components do not alter the system's overall functional behavior. This paper introduces an empirical framework to evaluate semantic preservation in LESS by mining model evolution data from HuggingFace. We extract commit histories, $\\textit{Model Cards}$, and performance metrics from a large number of models. To establish baselines, we conducted case studies in three domains, tracing performance changes across versions. Our analysis demonstrates how $\\textit{semantic drift}$ can be detected via evaluation metrics across commits and reveals common refactoring patterns based on commit message analysis. Although API constraints limited the possibility of estimating a full-scale threshold, our pipeline offers a foundation for defining community-accepted boundaries for semantic preservation. Our contributions include: (1) a large-scale dataset of ML model evolution, curated from 1.7 million Hugging Face entries via a reproducible pipeline using the native HF hub API, (2) a practical pipeline for the evaluation of semantic preservation for a subset of 536 models and 4000+ metrics and (3) empirical case studies illustrating semantic drift in practice.

This paper presents a review of existing gray literature, examining fairness requirements in AI context, with a focus on how they are defined across various application domains, managed throughout the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), and the causes, as well as the corresponding consequences of their violation by AI models. Our gray literature investigation shows various definitions of fairness requirements in AI systems, commonly emphasizing non-discrimination and equal treatment across different demographic and social attributes. Fairness requirement management practices vary across the SDLC, particularly in model training and bias mitigation, fairness monitoring and evaluation, and data handling practices. Fairness requirement violations are frequently linked, but not limited, to data representation bias, algorithmic and model design bias, human judgment, and evaluation and transparency gaps. The corresponding consequences include harm in a broad sense, encompassing specific professional and societal impacts as key examples, stereotype reinforcement, data and privacy risks, and loss of trust and legitimacy in AI-supported decisions.

This work introduces a hybrid thermoplasmonic and thermoelectric energy harvester that combines multiband plasmonic absorption with machine-learning-guided optimization to improve on-body energy conversion. A broadband metasurface made of cross-bowtie nanoantennas is designed to absorb infrared radiation across the 2 to 12 micron range, capturing human body emission, ambient infrared radiation, and near-infrared sunlight. Electromagnetic simulations show strong field enhancement in nanoscale antenna gaps, producing localized thermoplasmonic heating directly above flexible Bi2Te3 thermoelectric junctions. Coupled optical, thermal, and electrical modeling indicates that this localized heating increases the effective temperature difference from the typical 3 to 4 degrees C of standard wearable thermoelectric generators to approximately 13 degrees C. This results in a power density of about 0.15 mW per cm^2 under indoor-relevant infrared flux, representing a four- to six-fold improvement over existing flexible devices. A machine-learning surrogate model trained on multiphysics data predicts temperature rise and electrical output with high accuracy (R2 greater than 0.92) and identifies optimal device geometries through Pareto-front analysis.

This study provides a comprehensive performance analysis of Data Oriented Design (DOD) versus the traditional Object-Oriented Design (OOD), focusing on cache utilization and efficiency in multi-threaded environments. We developed and compared four distinct versions of the A* search algorithm: single-threaded OOD (ST-OOD), single-threaded DOD (ST-DOD), multi-threaded OOD (MT-OOD), and multi-threaded DOD (MT-DOD). The evaluation was based on metrics including execution time, memory usage, and CPU cache misses. In multi-threaded tests, the DOD implementation demonstrated considerable performance gains, with faster execution times and a lower number of raw system calls and cache misses. While OOD occasionally showed marginal advantages in memory usage or percentage-based cache miss rates, DOD's efficiency in data-intensive operations was more evident. Furthermore, our findings reveal that for a fine-grained task like the A* algorithm, the overhead associated with thread management led to single-threaded versions significantly outperforming their multi-threaded counterparts in both paradigms. We conclude that even when performance differences appear subtle in simple algorithms, the consistent advantages of DOD in critical metrics highlight its foundational architectural superiority, suggesting it is a more effective approach for maximizing hardware efficiency in complex, large-scale AI and parallel computing tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u6570\u636e\u5bfc\u5411\u8bbe\u8ba1(DOD)\u4e0e\u9762\u5411\u5bf9\u8c61\u8bbe\u8ba1(OOD)\u5728\u591a\u7ebf\u7a0b\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0DOD\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6570\u636e\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u64cd\u4f5c\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf", "motivation": "\u591a\u6838CPU\u4e0e\u4e3b\u5185\u5b58\u4e4b\u95f4\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u957f\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u9700\u8981\u786c\u4ef6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8303\u5f0f", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86A*\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u56db\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\uff1a\u5355\u7ebf\u7a0bOOD\u3001\u5355\u7ebf\u7a0bDOD\u3001\u591a\u7ebf\u7a0bOOD\u548c\u591a\u7ebf\u7a0bDOD\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u548cCPU\u7f13\u5b58\u672a\u547d\u4e2d\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u7ebf\u7a0b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cDOD\u5b9e\u73b0\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u539f\u59cb\u7cfb\u7edf\u8c03\u7528\u548c\u7f13\u5b58\u672a\u547d\u4e2d\u6b21\u6570\u66f4\u5c11\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4efb\u52a1\u5982A*\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5355\u7ebf\u7a0b\u7248\u672c\u5728\u591a\u7ebf\u7a0b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d", "conclusion": "\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u770b\u4f3c\u5fae\u5c0f\uff0c\u4f46DOD\u5728\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u4f18\u52bf\u7a81\u51fa\u4e86\u5176\u57fa\u7840\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21AI\u548c\u5e76\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cDOD\u662f\u6700\u5927\u5316\u786c\u4ef6\u6548\u7387\u7684\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5"}}

Additionally, it increases the mean lift-to-drag ratio by 11.8% over traditional Latin-hypercube sampling in wing design. Beyond improvements in accuracy and efficiency, Dflow-SUR offers three additional practical advantages: (i) enhanced control over guidance, (ii) lower surrogate uncertainty, and (iii) greater robustness to hyper-parameter tuning.\n  Together, these results demonstrate that Dflow-SUR is a highly promising framework, providing both scalability and high fidelity for generative aerodynamic design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Dflow-SUR\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u53cd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7269\u7406\u635f\u5931\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5f02\u6b65\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u53cd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u7269\u7406\u635f\u5931\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5f02\u6b65\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Dflow-SUR\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u7269\u7406\u635f\u5931\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u63a8\u7406\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5fae\u5206\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7ffc\u578b\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u7269\u7406\u635f\u5931\u964d\u4f4e4\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1174%\uff1b\u673a\u7ffc\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u5347\u963b\u6bd4\u5747\u503c\u63d0\u534711.8%\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Dflow-SUR\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u6c14\u52a8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

Traditional access controls are insufficient, as privacy risks often arise after access is granted; agents may use information in ways that compromise privacy, such as messaging humans, sharing context with other agents, making tool calls, persisting data, or generating derived private information. Existing approaches often treat privacy as a binary constraint, whether data is shareable or not, overlooking nuanced, role-specific, and computation-dependent privacy needs essential for regulatory compliance.\n  Agents, including those based on large language models, are inherently probabilistic and heuristic. There is no formal guarantee of how an agent will behave for any query, making them ill-suited for operations critical to security. To address this, we introduce AgentCrypt, a four-tiered framework for fine-grained, encrypted agent communication that adds a protection layer atop any AI agent platform. AgentCrypt spans unrestricted data exchange (Level 1) to fully encrypted computation using techniques such as homomorphic encryption (Level 4). Crucially, it guarantees the privacy of tagged data is always maintained, prioritizing privacy above correctness.\n  AgentCrypt ensures privacy across diverse interactions and enables computation on otherwise inaccessible data, overcoming barriers such as data silos. We implemented and tested it with Langgraph and Google ADK, demonstrating versatility across platforms. We also introduce a benchmark dataset simulating privacy-critical tasks at all privacy levels, enabling systematic evaluation and fostering the development of regulatable machine learning systems for secure agent communication and computation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, recent evidence shows that LLMs frequently hallucinate package names or generate dependencies containing known security vulnerabilities, posing significant risks to developers and downstream software supply chains. At the same time, quantization has become a widely adopted technique to reduce inference cost and enable deployment of LLMs on resource-constrained environments. Despite its popularity, little is known about how quantization affects the correctness and security of LLM-generated software dependencies while generating shell commands for package installation.\n  In this work, we conduct the first systematic empirical study of the impact of quantization on package hallucination and vulnerability risks in LLM-generated Go packages. We evaluate five Qwen model sizes under full-precision, 8-bit, and 4-bit quantization across three datasets (SO, MBPP, and paraphrase). Our results show that quantization substantially increases the package hallucination rate (PHR), with 4-bit models exhibiting the most severe degradation. We further find that even among the correctly generated packages, the vulnerability presence rate (VPR) rises as precision decreases, indicating elevated security risk in lower-precision models. Finally, our analysis of hallucinated outputs reveals that most fabricated packages resemble realistic URL-based Go module paths, such as most commonly malformed or non-existent GitHub and golang.org repositories, highlighting a systematic pattern in how LLMs hallucinate dependencies.

This study presents an improved protocol combining experimental testing and computational modelling to determine the mechanical properties of the brain-skull interface under shear loading. Brain tissue and brain-skull complex samples were extracted from sheep cadaver heads and subjected to shear loading. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to obtain accurate 3D geometries of the samples, which were then used to create computational grids (meshes) for simulation of the experiments using finite element (FE) models to determine subject-specific properties of the brain tissue and brain-skull interface. A second-order Ogden hyperelastic model was used for the brain tissue, and a cohesive layer was employed to model the brain-skull interface. Our results indicate that a cohesive layer captures the force-displacement and damage initiation of the brain-skull interface. The calibrated cohesive properties showed consistent patterns across samples, with maximum normal tractions ranging from 2.8-3.4 kPa and maximum tangential tractions from 1.8-2.1 kPa.

This costs both memory and throughput bottleneck limiting their efficient deployment. Towards reducing KV cache size during inference, we first investigate the effectiveness of existing KV cache eviction methods for CoT reasoning. Interestingly, we find that due to unstable token-wise scoring and the reduced effective KV budget caused by padding tokens, state-of-the-art (SoTA) eviction methods fail to maintain accuracy in the multi-batch setting. Additionally, these methods often generate longer sequences than the original model, as semantic-unaware token-wise eviction leads to repeated revalidation during reasoning. To address these issues, we present \\textbf{SkipKV}, a \\textbf{\\textit{training-free}} KV compression method for selective \\textit{eviction} and \\textit{generation} operating at a coarse-grained sentence-level sequence removal for efficient CoT reasoning. In specific, it introduces a \\textit{sentence-scoring metric} to identify and remove highly similar sentences while maintaining semantic coherence. To suppress redundant generation, SkipKV dynamically adjusts a steering vector to update the hidden activation states during inference enforcing the LRM to generate concise response. Extensive evaluations on multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of SkipKV in maintaining up to $\\mathbf{26.7}\\%$ improved accuracy compared to the alternatives, at a similar compression budget.

Despite identical circuits, optimizers, and Hamiltonians, the new version produced drastically different results. A systematic analysis revealed the root cause: the sampling budget -- the number of circuit executions (shots) per iteration. The library's implicit use of unlimited shots yielded dense probability distributions, whereas the v2 default of 10 000 shots captured only 23% of the state space.

Leveraging open-source, reasoning-enabled large language models (LLMs), the system moves beyond binary classification to generate structured eligibility assessments with interpretable reasoning chains that support human-in-the-loop review. This decision support tool represents eligibility as a dynamic state rather than a fixed determination, identifying matches when available and offering actionable recommendations that could render a patient eligible in the future.

One important factor is the inherent verbosity of programming languages, such as unnecessary formatting elements and lengthy boilerplate code. This leads to inflated token counts in both input and generated outputs, which increases inference costs and slows down the generation process. Prior work improves this through simplifying programming language grammar, reducing token usage across both code understanding and generation tasks. However, it is confined to syntactic transformations, leaving significant opportunities for token reduction unrealized at the semantic level.\n  In this work, we propose Token Sugar, a concept that replaces frequent and verbose code patterns with reversible, token-efficient shorthand in the source code. To realize this concept in practice, we designed a systematic solution that mines high-frequency, token-heavy patterns from a code corpus, maps each to a unique shorthand, and integrates them into LLM pretraining via code transformation. With this solution, we obtain 799 (code pattern, shorthand) pairs, which can reduce up to 15.1% token count in the source code and is complementary to existing syntax-focused methods. We further trained three widely used LLMs on Token Sugar-augmented data. Experimental results show that these models not only achieve significant token savings (up to 11.2% reduction) during generation but also maintain near-identical Pass@1 scores compared to baselines trained on unprocessed code.", "AI": {"tldr": "Token Sugar \u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u9ad8\u9891\u5197\u957f\u4ee3\u7801\u6a21\u5f0f\u66ff\u6362\u4e3a\u53ef\u9006\u7684\u7b80\u5199\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11 LLM \u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684 token \u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u6027\uff08\u5982\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u683c\u5f0f\u5143\u7d20\u548c\u5197\u957f\u7684\u6837\u677f\u4ee3\u7801\uff09\u5bfc\u81f4 token \u6570\u91cf\u81a8\u80c0\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u51cf\u6162\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u8bed\u6cd5\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u5c42\u9762\u7684 token \u51cf\u5c11\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff1a\u4ece\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u4e2d\u6316\u6398\u9ad8\u9891\u3001token \u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6a21\u5f0f\u521b\u5efa\u552f\u4e00\u7684\u7b80\u5199\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee3\u7801\u8f6c\u6362\u5c06\u7b80\u5199\u96c6\u6210\u5230 LLM \u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u3002\u6700\u7ec8\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86 799 \u5bf9\uff08\u4ee3\u7801\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u7b80\u5199\uff09\u5bf9\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528 Token Sugar \u589e\u5f3a\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684 LLM \u5728\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684 token \u8282\u7701\uff08\u6700\u9ad8 11.2% \u7684\u51cf\u5c11\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u672a\u5904\u7406\u4ee3\u7801\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u51e0\u4e4e\u76f8\u540c\u7684 Pass@1 \u5206\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "Token Sugar \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u6a21\u5f0f\u7b80\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u66ff\u6362\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86 LLM \u7684 token \u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\uff08\u6700\u9ad8 15.1%\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u964d\u4f4e LLM \u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Unlike other studies which form ILWE instances based on additional information obtained from side-channel attacks, we take a more direct approach to the problem by constructing our ILWE instance from only the obtained signatures. We outline and introduce novel techniques in our simulation designs such as modular polynomial arithmetic via matrices in $\\mathbb{R}$, as well as algorithms for handling large sample sizes efficiently.

We propose a practical, fully reproducible framework for evaluating medical AI security under realistic resource constraints. Our framework design covers multiple medical specialties stratified by clinical risk -- from high-risk domains such as emergency medicine and psychiatry to general practice -- addressing jailbreaking attacks (role-playing, authority impersonation, multi-turn manipulation) and privacy extraction attacks. All evaluation utilizes synthetic patient records requiring no IRB approval. The framework is designed to run entirely on consumer CPU hardware using freely available models, eliminating cost barriers.

A key limitation in existing research is the failure to distinguish between agreement with the abstract, high-level values of the Agile Manifesto and agreement with the concrete, day-to-day practices derived from the 12 Principles. This paper addresses this methodological gap by presenting the design and validation of two distinct instruments: the novel Manifesto Agreement Scale (MAS), and the Principle Agreement Scale (PAS), which is a systematic adaptation and refinement of a prior instrument.\n  We detail the systematic process of item creation and selection, survey design, and validation. The results demonstrate that both scales possess important internal consistency and construct validity. A convergence and divergence analysis, including Proportional Odds Logistic Regression, a Bland-Altman plot, and an Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC), reveals that while the two scales are moderately correlated, they are not interchangeable and capture distinct dimensions of agile agreement. The primary contribution of this work is a pair of publicly available instruments, validated within a specific demographic of Belgian IT professionals. These scales represent a critical initial step toward facilitating a more nuanced measurement of agile agreement, distinguishing agile agreement across various levels of perception and aiding in a more refined interpretation of person-agile fit.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u91cf\u8868(MAS\u548cPAS)\u6765\u533a\u5206\u654f\u6377\u5ba3\u8a00\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u4e0e\u5177\u4f53\u5b9e\u8df5\u95f4\u7684\u8ba4\u540c\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8bc1\u660e\u5b83\u4eec\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u662f\u654f\u6377\u8ba4\u540c\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u7ef4\u5ea6", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u672a\u80fd\u533a\u5206\u5bf9\u654f\u6377\u5ba3\u8a00\u62bd\u8c61\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u7684\u8ba4\u540c\u4e0e\u5bf912\u6761\u539f\u5219\u5177\u4f53\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u8ba4\u540c\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u7a7a\u767d", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6761\u76ee\u521b\u5efa\u4e0e\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u8c03\u67e5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5ba3\u8a00\u8ba4\u540c\u91cf\u8868(MAS)\u548c\u539f\u5219\u8ba4\u540c\u91cf\u8868(PAS)", "result": "\u4e24\u4e2a\u91cf\u8868\u5747\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u6548\u5ea6\uff0c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u5b83\u4eec\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u662f\u654f\u6377\u8ba4\u540c\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u7ef4\u5ea6", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u516c\u5f00\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5730\u6d4b\u91cf\u654f\u6377\u8ba4\u540c\u8fc8\u51fa\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u8ba4\u77e5\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u654f\u6377\u8ba4\u540c"}}

However, existing approaches encounter critical challenges, including imbalanced disease distributions and a lack of interpretability, resulting in biased or unreliable predictions. To address these issues, we propose the Knowledge graph-enhanced, Prototype-aware, and Interpretable (KPI) framework. KPI systematically integrates structured and trusted medical knowledge into a unified disease knowledge graph, constructs clinically meaningful disease prototypes, and employs contrastive learning to enhance predictive accuracy, which is particularly important for long-tailed diseases. Additionally, KPI utilizes large language models (LLMs) to generate patient-specific, medically relevant explanations, thereby improving interpretability and reliability. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that KPI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in predictive accuracy and provides clinically valid explanations that closely align with patient narratives, highlighting its practical value for patient-centered healthcare delivery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u540d\u4e3aKPI\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u589e\u5f3a\u3001\u539f\u578b\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u533b\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u75be\u75c5\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u60a3\u8005\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5982\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u62a5\u544a\u75c7\u72b6\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u75be\u75c5\u9884\u6d4b\u9762\u4e34\u75be\u75c5\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9884\u6d4b\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u5dee\u6216\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u75be\u75c5\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u53ef\u4fe1\u533b\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1b\u521b\u5efa\u4e34\u5e8a\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u75be\u75c5\u539f\u578b\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u60a3\u8005\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u533b\u5b66\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cKPI\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0e\u60a3\u8005\u53d9\u8ff0\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "conclusion": "KPI\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u4ee5\u60a3\u8005\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u533b\u7597\u4fdd\u5065\u670d\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Grounded in the person-object theory of interest (POI), we conceptualize enthusiasm as a short-term, activating expression of interest that combines positive affect, perceived relevance, and intention to re-engage. Experiencing such enthusiasm can temporarily shift CS attitudes and strengthen future engagement intentions, making it a valuable lens for evaluating brief outreach activities. To capture these dynamics, we developed a theoretically grounded questionnaire for pre-post assessment of the enthusiasm potential of CS interventions. Using data from more than 400 students participating in online CS courses, we examined age- and gender-related patterns in enthusiasm. The findings challenge the prevailing belief that early exposure is the primary pathway to sustained interest in CS. Instead, we identify a marked decline in enthusiasm during early adolescence, particularly among girls, alongside substantial variability in interest trajectories across age groups. Crucially, our analyses reveal that age is a more decisive factor than gender in shaping interest development and uncover key developmental breakpoints. Despite starting with lower baseline attitudes, older students showed the largest positive changes following the intervention, suggesting that well-designed short activities can effectively re-activate interest even at later ages. Overall, the study highlights the need for a dynamic, age-sensitive framework for CS education in which instructional strategies are aligned with developmental trajectories.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5206\u6790\u5e74\u9f84\u4e0e\u6027\u522b\u5bf9\u9752\u5c11\u5e74\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u5174\u8da3\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u65e9\u671f\u63a5\u89e6\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u9014\u5f84\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5e74\u9f84\u6bd4\u6027\u522b\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u5e74\u9f84\u654f\u611f\u7684CS\u6559\u80b2\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u666e\u904d\u8ba4\u4e3a\u65e9\u671f\u63a5\u89e6\u662f\u7ef4\u6301CS\u5174\u8da3\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5e74\u9f84\u548c\u6027\u522b\u56e0\u7d20\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7POI\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u6784\u5e74\u9f84\u548c\u6027\u522b\u5bf9CS\u5174\u8da3\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8ePOI\u7406\u8bba\u5f00\u53d1\u95ee\u5377\uff0c\u5bf9400\u591a\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u5728\u7ebfCS\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u8fdb\u884c\u524d\u6d4b\u540e\u6d4b\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5e74\u9f84\u548c\u6027\u522b\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u70ed\u60c5\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u9752\u6625\u671f\u65e9\u671f\u70ed\u60c5\u660e\u663e\u4e0b\u964d\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5973\u5b69\uff09\uff0c\u5e74\u9f84\u6bd4\u6027\u522b\u5bf9\u5174\u8da3\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u66f4\u5927\uff0c\u5e74\u957f\u5b66\u751f\u867d\u7136\u57fa\u7ebf\u6001\u5ea6\u8f83\u4f4e\u4f46\u5e72\u9884\u540e\u53d8\u5316\u6700\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u5e74\u9f84\u654f\u611f\u7684CS\u6559\u80b2\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6559\u5b66\u7b56\u7565\u5e94\u4e0e\u53d1\u5c55\u8f68\u8ff9\u76f8\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u77ed\u671f\u6d3b\u52a8\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u8f83\u5927\u5e74\u9f84\u4e5f\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u91cd\u65b0\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5174\u8da3\u3002"}}

It emphasizes a learner-centered approach that aligns gamification design with pedagogical goals, while mitigating risks such as the erosion of intrinsic motivation. A systematic literature review was conducted to identify ten widely discussed GDEs. Visual prototypes representing each element were developed, and a best-worst scaling (BWS) survey with 125 participants was administered to elicit preference rankings. Qualitative feedback was also collected to uncover motivational drivers. Learners consistently preferred GDEs that support learning processes directly-most notably progress bars, concept maps, immediate feedback, and achievements. Qualitative analysis revealed six recurring motivational themes, including visible progress, content relevance, and constructive feedback. The findings suggest that learners value gamification elements that are meaningfully integrated with educational content and support intrinsic motivation. Purpose-aligned gamification should prioritize tools that visualize learning progress and provide actionable feedback, rather than relying solely on extrinsic incentives.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u5bf9\u6559\u80b2\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u652f\u6301\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u5185\u5728\u52a8\u673a\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u76ee\u6807\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u6559\u5b66\u76ee\u6807\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u5185\u5728\u52a8\u673a\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u5341\u4e2a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8ba8\u8bba\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u539f\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86125\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u6700\u4f73-\u6700\u5dee\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9a\u6027\u53cd\u9988\u5206\u6790\u52a8\u673a\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "result": "\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u504f\u597d\u76f4\u63a5\u652f\u6301\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5982\u8fdb\u5ea6\u6761\u3001\u6982\u5ff5\u56fe\u3001\u5373\u65f6\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u6210\u5c31\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u516d\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u4e3b\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u53ef\u89c1\u8fdb\u5c55\u3001\u5185\u5bb9\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u5efa\u8bbe\u6027\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u91cd\u89c6\u4e0e\u6559\u80b2\u5185\u5bb9\u6709\u673a\u6574\u5408\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u5185\u5728\u52a8\u673a\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u5143\u7d20\u3002\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u5e94\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u5c55\u548c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u5728\u6fc0\u52b1\u3002"}}

Traditional evaluation methods, like human surveys, further add operational costs, highlighting the need for efficient, automated solutions. This research introduces Generative Agents as a means to tackle these challenges. These agents can rapidly and cost-effectively evaluate AI-generated content, simulating human judgment by rating aspects such as coherence, interestingness, clarity, fairness, and relevance. By incorporating these agents, businesses can streamline content generation and ensure consistent, high-quality output while minimizing reliance on costly human evaluations.

Despite this widespread adoption, the principles that determine their performance remain underexplored, leaving practitioners to rely on heuristics rather than principled design choices. We address this gap by deriving quantitative scaling principles for agent systems. We evaluate this across four diverse benchmarks: Finance-Agent, BrowseComp-Plus, PlanCraft, and Workbench. Using five canonical architectures (Single, Independent, Centralized, Decentralized, Hybrid) instantiated across three LLM families, we perform a controlled evaluation spanning 180 configurations with standardized tools and token budgets. We derive a predictive model using empirical coordination metrics, including efficiency, overhead, error amplification, and redundancy, that achieves cross-validated R^2=0.513. We identify three dominant effects: (1) a tool-coordination trade-off: under fixed computational budgets, tool-heavy tasks suffer disproportionately from multi-agent overhead. (2) a capability saturation: coordination yields diminishing or negative returns (beta=-0.408, p<0.001) once single-agent baselines exceed ~45%. (3) topology-dependent error amplification: independent agents amplify errors 17.2x through unchecked propagation, while centralized coordination contains this to 4.4x. Centralized coordination improves performance by 80.9% on parallelizable tasks like financial reasoning, while decentralized coordination excels on dynamic web navigation (+9.2% vs. +0.2%).

Motivated by this, this paper proposes a novel reinforced strategy injection mechanism (rSIM), that enables any LLM to become an RLM by employing a small planner to guide the LLM's CoT through the adaptive injection of reasoning strategies. To achieve this, the planner (leader agent) is jointly trained with an LLM (follower agent) using multi-agent RL (MARL), based on a leader-follower framework and straightforward rule-based rewards. Experimental results show that rSIM enables Qwen2.5-0.5B to become an RLM and significantly outperform Qwen2.5-14B. Moreover, the planner is generalizable: it only needs to be trained once and can be applied as a plug-in to substantially improve the reasoning capabilities of existing LLMs. In addition, the planner supports continual learning across various tasks, allowing its planning abilities to gradually improve and generalize to a wider range of problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u6ce8\u5165\u673a\u5236(rSIM)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c0f\u578b\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u6307\u5bfcLLM\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5177\u5907\u9ad8\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b", "motivation": "\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230LLM\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u51fa\u73b0\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u8fd0\u7528\u7684\"aha\"\u65f6\u523b\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u5c06\u5176\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u9886\u5bfc\u8005-\u8ddf\u968f\u8005\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u4e0eLLM", "result": "rSIM\u4f7f0.5B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a14B\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u5177\u5907\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b", "conclusion": "rSIM\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347LLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u5f88\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u6027"}}

This study introduces a comprehensive ML framework for CBR prediction using a dataset of 382 soil samples collected from various geoclimatic regions in T\u00fcrkiye. The dataset includes physicochemical soil properties relevant to bearing capacity, allowing multidimensional feature representation in a supervised learning context. Twelve ML algorithms were tested, including decision tree, random forest, extra trees, gradient boosting, xgboost, k-nearest neighbors, support vector regression, multi-layer perceptron, adaboost, bagging, voting, and stacking regressors. Each model was trained, validated, and evaluated to assess its generalization and robustness. Among them, the random forest regressor performed the best, achieving strong R2 scores of 0.95 (training), 0.76 (validation), and 0.83 (test). These outcomes highlight the model's powerful nonlinear mapping ability, making it a promising tool for predictive geotechnical tasks. The study supports the integration of intelligent, data-centric models in geotechnical engineering, offering an effective alternative to traditional methods and promoting digital transformation in infrastructure analysis and design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528382\u4e2a\u571f\u8033\u5176\u571f\u58e4\u6837\u672c\u9884\u6d4b\u52a0\u5dde\u627f\u8f7d\u6bd4(CBR)\u3002\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0cR2\u5206\u6570\u8fbe0.83\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f20\u7edf\u5ca9\u571f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684CBR\u6d4b\u5b9a\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u8d2f\u5165\u8bd5\u9a8c\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u5e38\u8017\u65f6\u3001\u6602\u8d35\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6216\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u571f\u58e4\u5256\u9762\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u5b9e\u7528\u3002\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7279\u522b\u662f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u4f7f\u5f97\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5efa\u6a21\u590d\u6742\u7684\u571f\u58e4\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4ece\u571f\u8033\u5176\u4e0d\u540c\u5730\u7406\u6c14\u5019\u533a\u57df\u6536\u96c6\u7684382\u4e2a\u571f\u58e4\u6837\u672c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e8612\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u3001\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u3001\u989d\u5916\u6811\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3001xgboost\u3001k\u8fd1\u90bb\u3001\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u56de\u5f52\u3001\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u5668\u3001adaboost\u3001bagging\u3001\u6295\u7968\u548c\u5806\u53e0\u56de\u5f52\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u56de\u5f52\u5668\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684R2\u5206\u6570\uff1a\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c60.95\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c60.76\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c60.83\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u7a81\u663e\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6620\u5c04\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u652f\u6301\u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5ca9\u571f\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u5206\u6790\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u8f6c\u578b\u3002"}}

Traditional anomaly detection techniques typically do `one-off' training on datasets crafted by experts or generated by fuzzers, potentially limiting their ability to generalize to unseen and more subtle attack strategies. Stopping at this point misses a key opportunity: a defender can actively challenge the attacker to find more nuanced attacks, which in turn can lead to more effective detection capabilities. Building on this concept, we propose Evo-Defender, an evolutionary framework that iteratively strengthens CPS defenses through a dynamic attacker-defender interaction. Evo-Defender includes a smart attacker that employs guided fuzzing to explore diverse, non-redundant attack strategies, while the self-evolving defender uses incremental learning to adapt to new attack patterns. We implement Evo-Defender on two realistic CPS testbeds: the Tennessee Eastman process and a Robotic Arm Assembly Workstation, injecting over 600 attack scenarios. In end-to-end attack detection experiments, Evo-Defender achieves up to 2.7% higher performance than state-of-the-art baselines on unseen scenarios, while utilizing training data more efficiently for faster and more robust detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "Evo-Defender\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u653b\u51fb\u8005-\u9632\u5fa1\u8005\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u8fdb\u5316\u589e\u5f3aCPS\u9632\u5fa1\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfCPS\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u5bb6\u6216\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u66f4\u9690\u853d\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u6297\u673a\u5236", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8fdb\u5316\u6846\u67b6Evo-Defender\uff1a\u667a\u80fd\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u4f7f\u7528\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f0f\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u6837\u653b\u51fb\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u9632\u5fa1\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u653b\u51fb\u6a21\u5f0f", "result": "\u5728\u7530\u7eb3\u897f\u4f0a\u58eb\u66fc\u6d41\u7a0b\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u88c5\u914d\u5de5\u4f5c\u7ad9\u4e24\u4e2aCPS\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u6ce8\u5165600+\u653b\u51fb\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u573a\u666f\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u53472.7%", "conclusion": "\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u80fd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5229\u7528\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u9c81\u68d2\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u5b89\u5168\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f"}}

To investigate its importance and to what extent it has been explored, we analyze real user-LLM dialogues from WildChat and find that: (1) The Dev Knowledge QA task accounts for 39.6% of interactions(highest among all tasks), revealing broad knowledge needs beyond code generation (32.3%). (2) Only 27.5% of real Dev Knowledge QA dialogues focus on code understanding, leaving out development knowledge-seeking. (3) Only 17.1% of real-world Dev Knowledge QA dialogues can be used for constructing a benchmark. Existing benchmarks have two primary limitations for evaluating the Dev Knowledge QA capability of LLMs. First, existing benchmarks offer a limited development knowledge scope, mainly focusing on code understanding and neglecting broader knowledge during development. Second, some benchmarks are not built from real user queries. To bridge this gap, we design a three-phase pipeline that transforms real-world dialogue into simple development knowledge-seeking QA pairs. Through this pipeline, we introduce SimpleDevQA, a multilingual benchmark derived from real user dialogues. It contains 2,740 QA pairs in three languages (English, Chinese, and Russian), and focuses on questions with unique, short, and verifiable answers for accurate and simple evaluation. Experiments show that: Code LLMs generally outperform general LLMs of similar scale; Knowledge injection with the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) strategy can boost LLM accuracy by 11.3% on average; LLMs show systematic overconfidence in Dev Knowledge QA, and the answering accuracy of LLMs shows a positive correlation with their stated confidence; Generally, LLMs with stronger code generation performance also exhibit stronger performance in Dev Knowledge QA.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86SimpleDevQA\u57fa\u51c6\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5f00\u53d1\u77e5\u8bc6\u95ee\u7b54\u5360\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u8bdd\u768439.6%\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6848\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801LLM\u548cRAG\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f00\u53d1\u77e5\u8bc6\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u4ee3\u7801\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u77e5\u8bc6\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4e14\u90e8\u5206\u57fa\u51c6\u672a\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u7528\u6237\u67e5\u8be2\u6784\u5efa\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7a0b\u5c06\u771f\u5b9e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7b80\u5355\u5f00\u53d1\u77e5\u8bc6\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u57fa\u51c6SimpleDevQA\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u77e5\u8bc6\u95ee\u7b54\u5360\u6bd4\u6700\u9ad8\uff0839.6%\uff09\uff1b\u4ee3\u7801LLM\u4f18\u4e8e\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u901a\u7528LLM\uff1bRAG\u7b56\u7565\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u738711.3%\uff1bLLM\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f00\u53d1\u77e5\u8bc6\u95ee\u7b54\u662f\u91cd\u8981\u4f46\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff0cSimpleDevQA\u57fa\u51c6\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u77e5\u8bc6\u95ee\u7b54\u6027\u80fd\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\u3002"}}

Also available on Zenodo: DOI 10.5281/zenodo.17533851", "summary": "Soil compaction is critical in construction engineering to ensure the stability of structures like road embankments and earth dams. Traditional methods for determining optimum moisture content (OMC) and maximum dry density (MDD) involve labor-intensive laboratory experiments, and empirical regression models have limited applicability and accuracy across diverse soil types. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques have emerged as alternatives for predicting these compaction parameters. However, ML models often struggle with prediction accuracy and generalizability, particularly with heterogeneous datasets representing various soil types. This study proposes an automated machine learning (AutoML) approach to predict OMC and MDD. AutoML automates algorithm selection and hyperparameter optimization, potentially improving accuracy and scalability. Through extensive experimentation, the study found that the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm provided the best performance, achieving R-squared values of 80.4% for MDD and 89.1% for OMC on a separate dataset.

Traditional detection methods that rely on regular expressions, fingerprint features, and high-entropy calculations often suffer from high false-positive rates. This not only reduces detection efficiency but also significantly increases the manual screening burden on developers. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent collaborative architectures have demonstrated remarkable potential for tackling complex tasks, offering a novel technological perspective for sensitive information detection. In response to these challenges, we propose Argus, a multi-agent collaborative framework for detecting sensitive information. Argus employs a three-tier detection mechanism that integrates key content, file context, and project reference relationships to effectively reduce false positives and enhance overall detection accuracy. To comprehensively evaluate Argus in real-world repository environments, we developed two new benchmarks, one to assess genuine leak detection capabilities and another to evaluate false-positive filtering performance. Experimental results show that Argus achieves up to 94.86% accuracy in leak detection, with a precision of 96.36%, recall of 94.64%, and an F1 score of 0.955.

Gelman and Loken refer to this freedom as leading to a \"garden of forking paths\". Although this freedom is often seen as an advantage, it also poses a threat to robustness and replicability: variations in analytical decisions, even when justifiable, can lead to divergent conclusions.\n  To better understand this risk, we conducted a so-called multiverse analysis on a published empirical SE paper. The paper we picked is a Mining Software Repositories study, as MSR studies commonly use non-trivial statistical models to analyze post-hoc, observational data. In the study, we identified nine pivotal analytical decisions-each with at least one equally defensible alternative and systematically reran all the 3,072 resulting analysis pipelines on the original dataset. Interestingly, only 6 of these universes (<0.2%) reproduced the published results; the overwhelming majority produced qualitatively different, and sometimes even opposite, findings.\n  This case study of a data analytical method commonly applied to empirical software engineering data reveals how methodological choices can exert a more profound influence on outcomes than is often acknowledged. We therefore advocate that SE researchers complement standard reporting with robustness checks across plausible analysis variants or, at least, explicitly justify each analytical decision. We propose a structured classification model to help classify and improve justification for methodological choices. Secondly, we show how the multiverse analysis is a practical tool in the methodological arsenal of SE researchers, one that can help produce more reliable, reproducible science.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5143\u5b87\u5b99\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\uff0c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u81ea\u7531\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ed3\u8bba\u5dee\u5f02\u5de8\u5927\uff0c\u547c\u5401\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u68c0\u9a8c\u5e76\u660e\u786e\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u9009\u62e9\u7406\u7531\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u3001\u64cd\u4f5c\u5316\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u4e0a\u6709\u5f88\u5927\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u201c\u5206\u53c9\u8def\u5f84\u82b1\u56ed\u201d\u73b0\u8c61\u53ef\u80fd\u5a01\u80c1\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u4e00\u7bc7\u5df2\u53d1\u8868\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bba\u6587\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u5143\u5b87\u5b99\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa9\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u5206\u6790\u51b3\u7b56\u70b9\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u70b9\u81f3\u5c11\u67091\u4e2a\u5408\u7406\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8fd0\u884c\u6240\u67093072\u79cd\u5206\u6790\u7ec4\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u4ec5\u67096\u79cd\u5206\u6790\u7ec4\u5408\uff08<0.2%\uff09\u590d\u73b0\u4e86\u539f\u59cb\u8bba\u6587\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u7edd\u5927\u591a\u6570\u7ec4\u5408\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u8d28\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u751a\u81f3\u76f8\u53cd\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u6bd4\u901a\u5e38\u627f\u8ba4\u7684\u66f4\u6df1\u8fdc\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u68c0\u9a8c\u6216\u660e\u786e\u8bba\u8bc1\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5206\u6790\u51b3\u7b56\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u3002"}}

However, LLM-empowered applications are vulnerable to Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) attacks, where instructions are injected via untrustworthy external data sources. This paper presents Rennervate, a defense framework to detect and prevent IPI attacks. Rennervate leverages attention features to detect the covert injection at a fine-grained token level, enabling precise sanitization that neutralizes IPI attacks while maintaining LLM functionalities. Specifically, the token-level detector is materialized with a 2-step attentive pooling mechanism, which aggregates attention heads and response tokens for IPI detection and sanitization.

To study the process of skill acquisition under fully controlled conditions, we bypass human subjects. Instead, we directly interface a generalist reinforcement learning agent with a spinning cylinder in a tabletop circulating water channel to maximize or minimize drag. This setup has several desirable properties. First, it is a physical system, with the rich interactions and complex dynamics that only the physical world has: the flow is highly chaotic and extremely difficult, if not impossible, to model or simulate accurately. Second, the objective -- drag minimization or maximization -- is easy to state and can be captured directly in the reward, yet good strategies are not obvious beforehand. Third, decades-old experimental studies provide recipes for simple, high-performance open-loop policies. Finally, the setup is inexpensive and far easier to reproduce than human studies. In our experiments we find that high-dimensional flow feedback lets the agent discover high-performance drag-control strategies with only minutes of real-world interaction. When we later replay the same action sequences without any feedback, we obtain almost identical performance. This shows that feedback, and in particular flow feedback, is not needed to execute the learned policy. Surprisingly, without flow feedback during training the agent fails to discover any well-performing policy in drag maximization, but still succeeds in drag minimization, albeit more slowly and less reliably. Our studies show that learning a high-performance skill can require richer information than executing it, and learning conditions can be kind or wicked depending solely on the goal, not on dynamics or policy complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u6765\u63a7\u5236\u6c34\u69fd\u4e2d\u65cb\u8f6c\u5706\u67f1\u4f53\u7684\u963b\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u6280\u80fd\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u5ea6\u6bd4\u6267\u884c\u6280\u80fd\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u5916\u90e8\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4eba\u7c7b\u5982\u4f55\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u6280\u80fd\uff08\u5982\u82b1\u6837\u6ed1\u51b0\u7684\u4e09\u5468\u8df3\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u7c7b\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u8f6c\u800c\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u6765\u63a2\u7a76\u6280\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u901a\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e0e\u684c\u9762\u5faa\u73af\u6c34\u69fd\u4e2d\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u5706\u67f1\u4f53\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6d41\u52a8\u53cd\u9988\u6765\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6216\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u963b\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u65e0\u53cd\u9988\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u6709\u6d41\u52a8\u53cd\u9988\u65f6\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u51e0\u5206\u949f\u5185\u5c31\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u963b\u529b\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u65e0\u53cd\u9988\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u5931\u8d25\uff08\u963b\u529b\u6700\u5927\u5316\uff09\u6216\u6548\u679c\u8f83\u5dee\uff08\u963b\u529b\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\uff09\u3002\u4f46\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u65e0\u9700\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b66\u4e60\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u6280\u80fd\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u6bd4\u6267\u884c\u8be5\u6280\u80fd\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4e14\u5b66\u4e60\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u96be\u6613\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4ec5\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6216\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002"}}

While traditional rule-based methods offer efficiency, their rigidity leads to high false positives or negatives and requires continuous manual maintenance. This paper proposes a novel, two-stage hybrid framework to democratize ML-based threat detection. The first stage employs intentionally loose YARA rules for coarse-grained filtering, optimized for high recall. The second stage utilizes an ML classifier to filter out false positives from the first stage's output. To overcome data scarcity, the system leverages Simula, a seedless synthetic data generation framework, enabling security analysts to create high-quality training datasets without extensive data science expertise or pre-labeled examples. A continuous feedback loop incorporates real-time investigation results to adaptively tune the ML model, preventing rule degradation.\n  This proposed model with active learning has been rigorously tested for a prolonged time in a production environment spanning tens of thousands of systems. The system handles initial raw log volumes often reaching 250 billion events per day, significantly reducing them through filtering and ML inference to a handful of daily tickets for human investigation. Live experiments over an extended timeline demonstrate a general improvement in the model's precision over time due to the active learning feature.

Current approaches typically employ a control-centric paradigm, forcing agents to navigate complex directory structures and irrelevant control logic. In this paper, we propose a paradigm shift from the standard Code Property Graphs (CPGs) to the concept of Data Transformation Graph (DTG) that inverts the topology by modeling data states as nodes and functions as edges, enabling agents to trace logic defects through data lineage rather than control flow. We introduce a multi-agent framework that reconciles data integrity navigation with control flow logic. Our theoretical analysis and case studies demonstrate that this approach resolves the \"Semantic Trap\" inherent in standard RAG systems in modern coding agents. We provide a comprehensive implementation in the form of Autonomous Issue Resolver (AIR), a self-improvement system for zero-touch code maintenance that utilizes neuro-symbolic reasoning and uses the DTG structure for scalable logic repair. Our approach has demonstrated good results on several SWE benchmarks, reaching a resolution rate of 87.1% on SWE-Verified benchmark.

However, this raises concerns about sensitive data leakage. Prior methods, relying on differential privacy within device-cloud collaboration frameworks, struggle to balance privacy and utility, exposing users to inference attacks or degrading fine-tuning performance. To address this, we propose PrivTune, an efficient and privacy-preserving fine-tuning framework via Split Learning (SL). The key idea of PrivTune is to inject crafted noise into token representations from the SL bottom model, making each token resemble the $n$-hop indirect neighbors. PrivTune formulates this as an optimization problem to compute the optimal noise vector, aligning with defense-utility goals. On this basis, it then adjusts the parameters (i.e., mean) of the $d_\u03c7$-Privacy noise distribution to align with the optimization direction and scales the noise according to token importance to minimize distortion. Experiments on five datasets (covering both classification and generation tasks) against three embedding inversion and three attribute inference attacks show that, using RoBERTa on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank dataset, PrivTune reduces the attack success rate to 10% with only a 3.33% drop in utility performance, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "PrivTune\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7Split Learning\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u6ce8\u5165\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u654f\u611f\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u8c03\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4f20\u79c1\u6709\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u654f\u611f\u6570\u636e\u6cc4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPrivTune\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u901a\u8fc7Split Learning\u5728\u5e95\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u6ce8\u5165\u7ecf\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u4f7f\u6bcf\u4e2atoken\u8868\u5f81\u63a5\u8fd1\u5176n\u8df3\u95f4\u63a5\u90bb\u5c45\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574d_\u03c7-\u9690\u79c1\u566a\u58f0\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u6765\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5931\u771f\u3002", "result": "\u57285\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9488\u5bf93\u7c7b\u5d4c\u5165\u53cd\u6f14\u548c3\u7c7b\u5c5e\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\uff0cPrivTune\u80fd\u5c06\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u964d\u81f310%\uff0c\u6548\u7528\u635f\u5931\u4ec53.33%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "PrivTune\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e91\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Federated satellite learning (FSL) enables joint model training without sharing raw data, but suffers from slow convergence due to intermittent connectivity and introduces critical trust challenges--where biased or falsified updates can arise across satellite constellations, including those injected through cyberattacks on inter-satellite or satellite-ground communication links. We propose OrbitChain, a blockchain-backed framework that empowers trustworthy multi-vendor collaboration in LEO networks. OrbitChain (i) offloads consensus to high-altitude platforms (HAPs) with greater computational capacity, (ii) ensures transparent, auditable provenance of model updates from different orbits owned by different vendors, and (iii) prevents manipulated or incomplete contributions from affecting global FSL model aggregation. Extensive simulations show that OrbitChain reduces computational and communication overhead while improving privacy, security, and global model accuracy. Its permissioned proof-of-authority ledger finalizes over 1000 blocks with sub-second latency (0.16,s, 0.26,s, 0.35,s for 1-of-5, 3-of-5, and 5-of-5 quorums). Moreover, OrbitChain reduces convergence time by up to 30 hours on real satellite datasets compared to single-vendor, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-time, multi-vendor learning.

Recently, Christ and Gunn (CRYPTO '24) introduced pseudorandom error-correcting codes (PRCs), which are equivalent to watermarks with strong robustness and quality guarantees. A PRC is a pseudorandom encryption scheme whose decryption algorithm tolerates a high rate of errors. Pseudorandomness ensures quality preservation of the watermark, and error tolerance of decryption translates to the watermark's ability to withstand modification of the content.\n  In the short time since the introduction of PRCs, several works (NeurIPS '24, RANDOM '25, STOC '25) have proposed new constructions. Curiously, all of these constructions are vulnerable to quasipolynomial-time distinguishing attacks. Furthermore, all lack robustness to edits over a constant-sized alphabet, which is necessary for a meaningfully robust LLM watermark. Lastly, they lack robustness to adversaries who know the watermarking detection key. Until now, it was not clear whether any of these properties was achievable individually, let alone together.\n  We construct pseudorandom codes that achieve all of the above: plausible subexponential pseudorandomness security, robustness to worst-case edits over a binary alphabet, and robustness against even computationally unbounded adversaries that have the detection key. Pseudorandomness rests on a new assumption that we formalize, the permuted codes conjecture, which states that a distribution of permuted noisy codewords is pseudorandom. We show that this conjecture is implied by the permuted puzzles conjecture used previously to construct doubly efficient private information retrieval. To give further evidence, we show that the conjecture holds against a broad class of simple distinguishers, including read-once branching programs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e9a\u6307\u6570\u4f2a\u968f\u673a\u6027\u3001\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u5b57\u6bcd\u8868\u7f16\u8f91\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6297\u5df2\u77e5\u5bc6\u94a5\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u4f2a\u968f\u673a\u7801\u6784\u9020\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u672f\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u5b89\u5168\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u4f2a\u968f\u673a\u7801\u6784\u9020\u5728\u51c6\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u533a\u5206\u653b\u51fb\u3001\u5e38\u6570\u5927\u5c0f\u5b57\u6bcd\u8868\u7f16\u8f91\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u6297\u5df2\u77e5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5bc6\u94a5\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u65b0\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7684\u7f6e\u6362\u7801\u731c\u60f3\u6784\u5efa\u4f2a\u968f\u673a\u7801\uff0c\u8be5\u731c\u60f3\u8ba4\u4e3a\u7f6e\u6362\u540e\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u7801\u5b57\u5206\u5e03\u662f\u4f2a\u968f\u673a\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u88ab\u4e4b\u524d\u7528\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u53cc\u9ad8\u6548\u79c1\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u7f6e\u6362\u8c1c\u9898\u731c\u60f3\u6240\u8574\u542b\u6765\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bc1\u636e\u652f\u6301\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u6784\u9020\u4e86\u5177\u5907\u4e9a\u6307\u6570\u4f2a\u968f\u673a\u6027\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u5b57\u6bcd\u8868\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u7f16\u8f91\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u6297\u5df2\u77e5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5bc6\u94a5\u653b\u51fb\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4f2a\u968f\u673a\u7801\uff0c\u4e3a\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u969c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e9a\u6307\u6570\u4f2a\u968f\u673a\u6027\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u5b57\u6bcd\u8868\u4e0a\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u7f16\u8f91\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u6297\u5df2\u77e5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5bc6\u94a5\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u4f2a\u968f\u673a\u7801\u6784\u9020\uff0c\u4e3aAI\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u6c34\u5370\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u969c\u3002"}}

We identify four core capabilities of FMs in multi-agent contexts: understanding, planning, efficient communication, and adaptation. Contrary to assumptions about the spontaneous emergence of such abilities, we provide extensive empirical evidence across 41 large language models showing that strong single-agent performance alone does not automatically yield robust multi-agent intelligence.

Unlike traditional single model prompting, agentic workflows integrate multiple specialized agents with different Large Language Models(LLMs), tool-augmented capabilities, orchestration logic, and external system interactions to form dynamic pipelines capable of autonomous decision-making and action. As adoption accelerates across industry and research, organizations face a central challenge: how to design, engineer, and operate production-grade agentic AI workflows that are reliable, observable, maintainable, and aligned with safety and governance requirements. This paper provides a practical, end-to-end guide for designing, developing, and deploying production-quality agentic AI systems. We introduce a structured engineering lifecycle encompassing workflow decomposition, multi-agent design patterns, Model Context Protocol(MCP), and tool integration, deterministic orchestration, Responsible-AI considerations, and environment-aware deployment strategies. We then present nine core best practices for engineering production-grade agentic AI workflows, including tool-first design over MCP, pure-function invocation, single-tool and single-responsibility agents, externalized prompt management, Responsible-AI-aligned model-consortium design, clean separation between workflow logic and MCP servers, containerized deployment for scalable operations, and adherence to the Keep it Simple, Stupid (KISS) principle to maintain simplicity and robustness. To demonstrate these principles in practice, we present a comprehensive case study: a multimodal news-analysis and media-generation workflow.

Existing discovery methods depend on unreliable user descriptions or biased popularity metrics, hindering usability. We present CARLoS, a large-scale framework for characterizing LoRAs without requiring additional metadata. Analyzing over 650 LoRAs, we employ them in image generation over a variety of prompts and seeds, as a credible way to assess their behavior. Using CLIP embeddings and their difference to a base-model generation, we concisely define a three-part representation: Directions, defining semantic shift; Strength, quantifying the significance of the effect; and Consistency, quantifying how stable the effect is. Using these representations, we develop an efficient retrieval framework that semantically matches textual queries to relevant LoRAs while filtering overly strong or unstable ones, outperforming textual baselines in automated and human evaluations. While retrieval is our primary focus, the same representation also supports analyses linking Strength and Consistency to legal notions of substantiality and volition, key considerations in copyright, positioning CARLoS as a practical system with broader relevance for LoRA analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "CARLoS\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790LoRA\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u3001\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u5143\u6570\u636e\u7684LoRA\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff08\u5982LoRAs\uff09\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e9e\u5927\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u7528\u6237\u63cf\u8ff0\u6216\u6709\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u6d41\u884c\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790650\u591a\u4e2aLoRAs\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u79cd\u5b50\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528CLIP\u5d4c\u5165\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\uff08\u8bed\u4e49\u504f\u79fb\uff09\u3001\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff08\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u6027\uff09\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08\u6548\u679c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff09\u7684\u4e09\u90e8\u5206\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u5339\u914d\u6587\u672c\u67e5\u8be2\u5230\u76f8\u5173LoRAs\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8fc7\u6ee4\u8fc7\u5f3a\u6216\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684LoRAs\uff0c\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "CARLoS\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684LoRA\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u5176\u8868\u5f81\u8fd8\u53ef\u652f\u6301\u5c06\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u7248\u6743\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u610f\u613f\u6027\u7b49\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6982\u5ff5\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728LoRA\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

To this end, we introduce EcomBench, a holistic E-commerce Benchmark designed to evaluate agent performance in realistic e-commerce environments. EcomBench is built from genuine user demands embedded in leading global e-commerce ecosystems and is carefully curated and annotated through human experts to ensure clarity, accuracy, and domain relevance. It covers multiple task categories within e-commerce scenarios and defines three difficulty levels that evaluate agents on key capabilities such as deep information retrieval, multi-step reasoning, and cross-source knowledge integration.

MLLMs are trained to represent vision and language in the same embedding space, yet they cannot perform the same tasks in both modalities. Our benchmarks contain samples with the same semantic information in three modalities (image, text, mixed) and we show that state-of-the-art MLLMs cannot consistently reason over these different modalities. We evaluate 15 MLLMs and find that the degree of modality inconsistency varies substantially, even when accounting for problems with text recognition (OCR). Neither rendering text as image nor rendering an image as text solves the inconsistency. Even if OCR is correct, we find that visual characteristics (text colour and resolution, but not font) and the number of vision tokens have an impact on model performance. Finally, we find that our consistency score correlates with the modality gap between text and images, highlighting a mechanistic interpretation of cross-modal inconsistent MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86REST\u548cREST+\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5373\u4f7fOCR\u6b63\u786e\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u91cf\u4ecd\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u4e2d\u6267\u884c\u76f8\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u521b\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u6587\u672c\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u4e09\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u76f8\u540c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f3015\u4e2a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u63a8\u7406\uff1b\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u91cf\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u8ddd\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u91ca\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}
