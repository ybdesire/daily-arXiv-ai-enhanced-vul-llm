### [1] [A Detailed Comparative Analysis of Blockchain Consensus Mechanisms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15730)
*Kaeli Andrews,Linh Ngo,Md Amiruzzaman*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 对比分析PoW与PoS共识机制在能耗、安全性等七个关键指标的表现，揭示各自优缺点及混合设计的潜力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为未来区块链基础设施开发提供平衡去中心化、性能和生态责任的参考

Method: 基于近期学术研究和真实区块链数据的全面比较分析

Result: PoW提供强安全性但高能耗、低吞吐量；PoS效率更高但存在验证者集中化和安全成熟度问题

Conclusion: 两种机制各有取舍，混合设计可能结合PoW安全性与PoS效率及可持续性优势

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of two dominant blockchain consensus mechanisms, Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS), evaluated across seven critical metrics: energy use, security, transaction speed, scalability, centralization risk, environmental impact, and transaction fees. Utilizing recent academic research and real-world blockchain data, the study highlights that PoW offers robust, time-tested security but suffers from high energy consumption, slower throughput, and centralization through mining pools. In contrast, PoS demonstrates improved scalability and efficiency, significantly reduced environmental impact, and more stable transaction fees, however it raises concerns over validator centralization and long-term security maturity. The findings underscore the trade-offs inherent in each mechanism and suggest hybrid designs may combine PoW's security with PoS's efficiency and sustainability. The study aims to inform future blockchain infrastructure development by striking a balance between decentralization, performance, and ecological responsibility.

*Sai Sitharaman,Hassan Karim,Deepti Gupta,Mudit Tyagi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Novel PAM framework combining NGAC with hypergraph semantics for scalable privileged access management in multi-cloud environments, achieving sub-linear complexity and 10x improvement over traditional ABAC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PAM solutions with ABAC exhibit O(n^3) complexity, making real-time privilege analysis intractable at enterprise scale in multi-cloud environments.

Method: Integration of NIST's NGAC with hypergraph semantics using labeled hyperedges to model complex privilege relationships, with formal complexity analysis proving O(sqrt n) traversal and O(n log n) detection time.

Result: Experimental validation on AWS systems (200-4000 users) showed 10x improvement over ABAC and 4x improvement over standard NGAC-DAG, enabling sub-second privilege detection at scale.

Conclusion: The hypergraph-based NGAC framework effectively addresses scalability crisis in multi-cloud PAM, enabling real-time detection of privilege escalation, over-privileged users, and lateral movement pathways.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of multi-cloud environments has amplified risks associated with privileged access mismanagement. Traditional Privileged Access Management (PAM) solutions based on Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) exhibit cubic O(n^3) complexity, rendering real-time privilege analysis intractable at enterprise scale. We present a novel PAM framework integrating NIST's Next Generation Access Control (NGAC) with hypergraph semantics to address this scalability crisis. Our approach leverages hypergraphs with labeled hyperedges to model complex, multi-dimensional privilege relationships, achieving sub-linear O(sqrt n) traversal complexity and O(nlogn) detection time-rigorously proven through formal complexity analysis. We introduce a 3-Dimensional Privilege Analysis framework encompassing Attack Surface, Attack Window, and Attack Identity to systematically identify privilege vulnerabilities. Experimental validation on AWS-based systems with 200-4000 users demonstrates 10x improvement over ABAC and 4x improvement over standard NGAC-DAG, enabling sub-second privilege detection at scale. Real-world use cases validate detection of privilege escalation chains, over-privileged users, and lateral movement pathways in multi-cloud infrastructures.

### [4] [Lifefin: Escaping Mempool Explosions in DAG-based BFT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15936)
*Jianting Zhang,Sen Yang,Alberto Sonnino,Sebastián Loza,Aniket Kate*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Lifefin is a self-stabilizing protocol that addresses liveness vulnerabilities in DAG-based BFT protocols by using Agreement on Common Subset (ACS) to prevent mempool explosions while maintaining high throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DAG-based BFT protocols face fundamental liveness vulnerabilities where adversaries can trigger mempool explosions to prevent transaction commitment, compromising protocol liveness.

Method: Lifefin integrates with existing DAG-based BFT protocols using ACS mechanism, allowing nodes to commit transactions with bounded resource usage even under adverse conditions.

Result: When integrated with Sailfish and Mysticeti, Lifefin variants achieve comparable throughput with minimal additional latency while effectively eliminating liveness vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: Lifefin provides a generic solution that imposes minimal overhead in normal operation while ensuring liveness resilience against mempool explosion attacks in DAG-based BFT systems.

Abstract: Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT) protocols have emerged as promising solutions for high-throughput blockchains. By decoupling data dissemination from transaction ordering and constructing a well-connected DAG in the mempool, these protocols enable zero-message ordering and implicit view changes. However, we identify a fundamental liveness vulnerability: an adversary can trigger mempool explosions to prevent transaction commitment, ultimately compromising the protocol's liveness.
  In response, this work presents Lifefin, a generic and self-stabilizing protocol designed to integrate seamlessly with existing DAG-based BFT protocols and circumvent such vulnerabilities. Lifefin leverages the Agreement on Common Subset (ACS) mechanism, allowing nodes to escape mempool explosions by committing transactions with bounded resource usage even in adverse conditions. As a result, Lifefin imposes (almost) zero overhead in typical cases while effectively eliminating liveness vulnerabilities.
  To demonstrate the effectiveness of Lifefin, we integrate it into two state-of-the-art DAG-based BFT protocols, Sailfish and Mysticeti, resulting in two enhanced variants: Sailfish-Lifefin and Mysticeti-Lifefin. We implement these variants and compare them with the original Sailfish and Mysticeti systems. Our evaluation demonstrates that Lifefin achieves comparable transaction throughput while introducing only minimal additional latency to resist similar attacks.

*Osama Zafar,Rosemarie Santa González,Alfonso Morales,Erman Ayday*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Digital Agriculture Sandbox is a secure platform that enables privacy-preserving collaboration between farmers and researchers using federated learning and differential privacy techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Farmers are hesitant to share valuable agricultural data due to privacy concerns, limiting research opportunities to address global food challenges.

Method: The platform uses federated learning, differential privacy, and secure data analysis methods to analyze farm data without exposing private information.

Result: Creates a safe collaboration space where farmers can share data comfortably and researchers can build useful tools without sensitive information leaving farmers' systems.

Conclusion: The platform successfully bridges the gap between farm data privacy and utilization, enabling important agricultural discoveries while protecting farmer privacy.

Abstract: Digital agriculture is transforming the way we grow food by utilizing technology to make farming more efficient, sustainable, and productive. This modern approach to agriculture generates a wealth of valuable data that could help address global food challenges, but farmers are hesitant to share it due to privacy concerns. This limits the extent to which researchers can learn from this data to inform improvements in farming. This paper presents the Digital Agriculture Sandbox, a secure online platform that solves this problem. The platform enables farmers (with limited technical resources) and researchers to collaborate on analyzing farm data without exposing private information. We employ specialized techniques such as federated learning, differential privacy, and data analysis methods to safeguard the data while maintaining its utility for research purposes. The system enables farmers to identify similar farmers in a simplified manner without needing extensive technical knowledge or access to computational resources. Similarly, it enables researchers to learn from the data and build helpful tools without the sensitive information ever leaving the farmer's system. This creates a safe space where farmers feel comfortable sharing data, allowing researchers to make important discoveries. Our platform helps bridge the gap between maintaining farm data privacy and utilizing that data to address critical food and farming challenges worldwide.

*Strahinja Janjuesvic,Anna Baron Garcia,Sohrob Kazerounian*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Introduces a novel MCP-based C2 architecture for autonomous red teaming that improves goal-directed behavior while reducing detection artifacts, addressing hallucinations and ethical concerns in AI-powered cybersecurity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative AI approaches for offensive cybersecurity face trade-offs between generality vs specialization, with challenges like hallucinations and ethical concerns.

Method: Proposes a Model Context Protocol (MCP) based command & control architecture for coordinating distributed reconnaissance agents with asynchronous, parallel operations and real-time intelligence sharing.

Result: Experimental comparisons show drastic reductions in manual effort and detection footprint compared to traditional C2 systems.

Conclusion: The MCP-enabled C2 framework represents a significant step toward realistic AI-driven red team operations that can simulate advanced threats while informing defensive system development.

Abstract: Generative AI is reshaping offensive cybersecurity by enabling autonomous red team agents that can plan, execute, and adapt during penetration tests. However, existing approaches face trade-offs between generality and specialization, and practical deployments reveal challenges such as hallucinations, context limitations, and ethical concerns. In this work, we introduce a novel command & control (C2) architecture leveraging the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to coordinate distributed, adaptive reconnaissance agents covertly across networks. Notably, we find that our architecture not only improves goal-directed behavior of the system as whole, but also eliminates key host and network artifacts that can be used to detect and prevent command & control behavior altogether. We begin with a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art generative red teaming methods, from fine-tuned specialist models to modular or agentic frameworks, analyzing their automation capabilities against task-specific accuracy. We then detail how our MCP-based C2 can overcome current limitations by enabling asynchronous, parallel operations and real-time intelligence sharing without periodic beaconing. We furthermore explore advanced adversarial capabilities of this architecture, its detection-evasion techniques, and address dual-use ethical implications, proposing defensive measures and controlled evaluation in lab settings. Experimental comparisons with traditional C2 show drastic reductions in manual effort and detection footprint. We conclude with future directions for integrating autonomous exploitation, defensive LLM agents, predictive evasive maneuvers, and multi-agent swarms. The proposed MCP-enabled C2 framework demonstrates a significant step toward realistic, AI-driven red team operations that can simulate advanced persistent threats while informing the development of next-generation defensive systems.

*Ashwin Poudel,Utsav Poudel,Dikshyanta Aryal,Anuj Nepal,Pranish Pathak,Subramaniyaswamy V*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Post-quantum e-voting system combining Falcon signatures, biometric authentication, and blockchain for secure voter verification and tamper-proof voting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address quantum computing threats to cryptography by creating a secure, scalable e-voting framework with quantum-resistant security.

Method: Uses Falcon lattice-based signatures, MobileNetV3/AdaFace biometrics with anti-spoofing, and permissioned blockchain for vote storage.

Result: Achieved low latency, ACER below 3.5% on CelebA Spoof and 8.2% on WFAS, with minimal blockchain gas overhead (3.3% registration, 0.15% voting).

Conclusion: System provides scalable, efficient quantum-resilient e-voting with strong authentication, integrity, and transparency.

Abstract: The rapid growth of quantum computing poses a threat to the cryptographic foundations of digital systems, requiring the development of secure and scalable electronic voting (evoting) frameworks. We introduce a post-quantum-secure evoting architecture that integrates Falcon lattice-based digital signatures, biometric authentication via MobileNetV3 and AdaFace, and a permissioned blockchain for tamper-proof vote storage. Voter registration involves capturing facial embeddings, which are digitally signed using Falcon and stored on-chain to ensure integrity and non-repudiation. During voting, real-time biometric verification is performed using anti-spoofing techniques and cosine-similarity matching. The system demonstrates low latency and robust spoof detection, monitored through Prometheus and Grafana for real-time auditing. The average classification error rates (ACER) are below 3.5% on the CelebA Spoof dataset and under 8.2% on the Wild Face Anti-Spoofing (WFAS) dataset. Blockchain anchoring incurs minimal gas overhead, approximately 3.3% for registration and 0.15% for voting, supporting system efficiency, auditability, and transparency. The experimental results confirm the system's scalability, efficiency, and resilience under concurrent loads. This approach offers a unified solution to address key challenges in voter authentication, data integrity, and quantum-resilient security for digital systems.

*Yijun Yang,Lichao Wang,Jianping Zhang,Chi Harold Liu,Lanqing Hong,Qiang Xu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: MFA框架通过注意力转移攻击揭示了VLMs的安全漏洞，在对抗性图像攻击中达到58.5%成功率，远超现有方法34%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs部署了多种防御机制但真实世界鲁棒性未经充分研究，需要系统评估对抗攻击下的防御效果

Method: 提出注意力转移攻击(ATA)隐藏有害指令于元任务中，结合轻量级迁移增强算法和重复策略绕过输入输出级过滤器

Result: MFA在主流VLMs上达到58.5%成功率，商业模型上52.8%成功率，对抗图像可跨模型迁移

Conclusion: 当前防御机制存在严重安全漏洞，共享视觉表示造成跨模型安全隐患，需重新评估VLM安全架构

Abstract: The growing misuse of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has led providers to deploy multiple safeguards, including alignment tuning, system prompts, and content moderation. However, the real-world robustness of these defenses against adversarial attacks remains underexplored. We introduce Multi-Faceted Attack (MFA), a framework that systematically exposes general safety vulnerabilities in leading defense-equipped VLMs such as GPT-4o, Gemini-Pro, and Llama-4. The core component of MFA is the Attention-Transfer Attack (ATA), which hides harmful instructions inside a meta task with competing objectives. We provide a theoretical perspective based on reward hacking to explain why this attack succeeds. To improve cross-model transferability, we further introduce a lightweight transfer-enhancement algorithm combined with a simple repetition strategy that jointly bypasses both input-level and output-level filters without model-specific fine-tuning. Empirically, we show that adversarial images optimized for one vision encoder transfer broadly to unseen VLMs, indicating that shared visual representations create a cross-model safety vulnerability. Overall, MFA achieves a 58.5% success rate and consistently outperforms existing methods. On state-of-the-art commercial models, MFA reaches a 52.8% success rate, surpassing the second-best attack by 34%. These results challenge the perceived robustness of current defense mechanisms and highlight persistent safety weaknesses in modern VLMs. Code: https://github.com/cure-lab/MultiFacetedAttack

### [9] [ART: A Graph-based Framework for Investigating Illicit Activity in Monero via Address-Ring-Transaction Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16192)
*Andrea Venturi,Imanol Jerico-Yoldi,Francesco Zola,Raul Orduna*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于图的方法来分析和检测Monero隐私加密货币中犯罪活动的行为模式，通过构建地址-环-交易图，提取特征训练机器学习模型来识别犯罪操作模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着执法机构在加密货币取证方面的进步，犯罪分子转向使用Monero等隐私币来隐藏非法资金流动，由于其强大的隐私保护特性，传统区块链分析无效，因此需要新的分析方法。

Method: 构建地址-环-交易图，从标记的交易中提取结构性和时间性特征，使用这些特征训练机器学习模型。

Result: 开发出能够检测类似犯罪行为模式的机器学习模型，支持在隐私保护区块链生态系统中的调查工作。

Conclusion: 这项工作是为开发支持隐私保护区块链调查的分析工具迈出的第一步，有助于未来的调查策略制定和非法活动打击。

Abstract: As Law Enforcement Agencies advance in cryptocurrency forensics, criminal actors aiming to conceal illicit fund movements increasingly turn to "mixin" services or privacy-based cryptocurrencies. Monero stands out as a leading choice due to its strong privacy preserving and untraceability properties, making conventional blockchain analysis ineffective. Understanding the behavior and operational patterns of criminal actors within Monero is therefore challenging and it is essential to support future investigative strategies and disrupt illicit activities. In this work, we propose a case study in which we leverage a novel graph-based methodology to extract structural and temporal patterns from Monero transactions linked to already discovered criminal activities. By building Address-Ring-Transaction graphs from flagged transactions, we extract structural and temporal features and use them to train Machine Learning models capable of detecting similar behavioral patterns that could highlight criminal modus operandi. This represents a first partial step toward developing analytical tools that support investigative efforts in privacy-preserving blockchain ecosystems

### [10] [PSM: Prompt Sensitivity Minimization via LLM-Guided Black-Box Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16209)
*Huseein Jawad,Nicolas Brunel*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a lightweight framework called shield appending to protect system prompts in LLMs from extraction attacks by adding a protective textual layer, formulated as a utility-constrained optimization problem solved using an LLM-as-optimizer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: System prompts often contain sensitive information vulnerable to extraction attacks through adversarial queries, and existing defenses are heuristic, computationally heavy, or unsuitable for black-box APIs.

Method: The approach uses an LLM-as-optimizer to search for optimal SHIELDs that minimize prompt leakage while maintaining task utility above a threshold, measured by semantic fidelity to baseline outputs.

Result: Empirical results show optimized SHIELDs significantly reduce prompt leakage against various extraction attacks, outperforming baseline defenses without compromising functionality.

Conclusion: The work offers a practical, black-box method for robust, utility-aware prompt hardening in LLM security, with code publicly available.

Abstract: System prompts are critical for guiding the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet they often contain proprietary logic or sensitive information, making them a prime target for extraction attacks. Adversarial queries can successfully elicit these hidden instructions, posing significant security and privacy risks. Existing defense mechanisms frequently rely on heuristics, incur substantial computational overhead, or are inapplicable to models accessed via black-box APIs. This paper introduces a novel framework for hardening system prompts through shield appending, a lightweight approach that adds a protective textual layer to the original prompt. Our core contribution is the formalization of prompt hardening as a utility-constrained optimization problem. We leverage an LLM-as-optimizer to search the space of possible SHIELDs, seeking to minimize a leakage metric derived from a suite of adversarial attacks, while simultaneously preserving task utility above a specified threshold, measured by semantic fidelity to baseline outputs. This black-box, optimization-driven methodology is lightweight and practical, requiring only API access to the target and optimizer LLMs. We demonstrate empirically that our optimized SHIELDs significantly reduce prompt leakage against a comprehensive set of extraction attacks, outperforming established baseline defenses without compromising the model's intended functionality. Our work presents a paradigm for developing robust, utility-aware defenses in the escalating landscape of LLM security.

### [11] [Q-MLLM: Vector Quantization for Robust Multimodal Large Language Model Security](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16229)
*Wei Zhao,Zhe Li,Yige Li,Jun Sun*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Q-MLLM is a novel multimodal large language model architecture that uses two-level vector quantization to defend against adversarial attacks on visual inputs while maintaining multimodal reasoning capabilities, achieving near-perfect defense rates with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks through visual inputs due to the continuous nature of visual representations and inadequate transfer of text-based safety mechanisms to visual content.

Method: Integration of two-level vector quantization (pixel-patch and semantic levels) to create a discrete bottleneck that blocks attack pathways, combined with a two-stage training methodology for robust learning.

Result: Q-MLLM achieves significantly better defense success rates (100% against jailbreak attacks except one case) than existing approaches while maintaining competitive performance on utility benchmarks.

Conclusion: Vector quantization serves as an effective defense mechanism for secure multimodal AI systems without requiring expensive safety-specific fine-tuning or detection overhead.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in cross-modal understanding, but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks through visual inputs despite robust textual safety mechanisms. These vulnerabilities arise from two core weaknesses: the continuous nature of visual representations, which allows for gradient-based attacks, and the inadequate transfer of text-based safety mechanisms to visual content. We introduce Q-MLLM, a novel architecture that integrates two-level vector quantization to create a discrete bottleneck against adversarial attacks while preserving multimodal reasoning capabilities. By discretizing visual representations at both pixel-patch and semantic levels, Q-MLLM blocks attack pathways and bridges the cross-modal safety alignment gap. Our two-stage training methodology ensures robust learning while maintaining model utility. Experiments demonstrate that Q-MLLM achieves significantly better defense success rate against both jailbreak attacks and toxic image attacks than existing approaches. Notably, Q-MLLM achieves perfect defense success rate (100\%) against jailbreak attacks except in one arguable case, while maintaining competitive performance on multiple utility benchmarks with minimal inference overhead. This work establishes vector quantization as an effective defense mechanism for secure multimodal AI systems without requiring expensive safety-specific fine-tuning or detection overhead.

### [12] [Multi-Domain Security for 6G ISAC: Challenges and Opportunities in Transportation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16316)
*Musa Furkan Keskin,Muralikrishnan Srinivasan,Onur Gunlu,Hui Chen,Panagiotis Papadimitratos,Magnus Almgren,Zhongxia Simon He,Henk Wymeersch*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Identifies security vulnerabilities in 6G integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) for transportation across cyber-physical, physical-layer, and protocol domains, proposing a unified security framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the unique security vulnerabilities arising from the tight integration of sensing and communication in 6G-enabled transportation, which creates new attack surfaces not present in standalone systems.

Method: The method involves analyzing and identifying security challenges in three interrelated domains: cyber-physical (sensor/actuator manipulation), physical-layer (signal spoofing/jamming), and protocol (inability of cryptography to detect lower-layer attacks).

Result: The analysis reveals specific vulnerabilities such as misleading perception/control, signal interception, and protocol-level gaps in attack detection, highlighting the need for cross-domain security measures.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by proposing a multi-domain security vision and an integrated security framework to provide unified protection for 6G ISAC in transportation, addressing the identified vulnerabilities holistically.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) will be central to 6G-enabled transportation, providing both seamless connectivity and high-precision sensing. However, this tight integration exposes attack points not encountered in pure sensing and communication systems. In this article, we identify unique ISAC-induced security challenges and opportunities in three interrelated domains: cyber-physical (where manipulation of sensors and actuators can mislead perception and control), physical-layer (where over-the-air signals are vulnerable to spoofing and jamming) and protocol (where complex cryptographic protocols cannot detect lower-layer attacks). Building on these insights, we put forward a multi-domain security vision for 6G transportation and propose an integrated security framework that unifies protection across domains.

TL;DR: 论文提出了第一种针对嵌入式AI的间接环境越狱攻击方法，通过环境中的恶意指令而非直接提示来绕过安全机制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 嵌入式AI系统对环境中指令存在盲目信任，这种信任可能被攻击者利用进行间接越狱攻击

Method: 开发了两个开源框架：SHAWSHANK（自动攻击生成框架）和SHAWSHANK-FORGE（基准测试生成框架），并创建了SHAWSHANK-BENCH基准测试集

Result: 在3,957个任务场景组合测试中，SHAWSHANK优于11种现有方法，成功攻破了所有6个测试的VLM模型

Conclusion: 当前防御措施只能部分缓解IEJ攻击，嵌入式AI对环境中指令的盲目信任构成严重安全漏洞

Abstract: The adoption of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in embodied AI agents, while being effective, brings safety concerns such as jailbreaking. Prior work have explored the possibility of directly jailbreaking the embodied agents through elaborated multi-modal prompts. However, no prior work has studied or even reported indirect jailbreaks in embodied AI, where a black-box attacker induces a jailbreak without issuing direct prompts to the embodied agent. In this paper, we propose, for the first time, indirect environmental jailbreak (IEJ), a novel attack to jailbreak embodied AI via indirect prompt injected into the environment, such as malicious instructions written on a wall. Our key insight is that embodied AI does not ''think twice'' about the instructions provided by the environment -- a blind trust that attackers can exploit to jailbreak the embodied agent. We further design and implement open-source prototypes of two fully-automated frameworks: SHAWSHANK, the first automatic attack generation framework for the proposed attack IEJ; and SHAWSHANK-FORGE, the first automatic benchmark generation framework for IEJ. Then, using SHAWSHANK-FORGE, we automatically construct SHAWSHANK-BENCH, the first benchmark for indirectly jailbreaking embodied agents. Together, our two frameworks and one benchmark answer the questions of what content can be used for malicious IEJ instructions, where they should be placed, and how IEJ can be systematically evaluated. Evaluation results show that SHAWSHANK outperforms eleven existing methods across 3,957 task-scene combinations and compromises all six tested VLMs. Furthermore, current defenses only partially mitigate our attack, and we have responsibly disclosed our findings to all affected VLM vendors.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Ensemble LLM framework boosts text categorization performance by up to 65% F1-score over single models, achieving near human-level accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address individual LLM weaknesses like inconsistency, hallucination, and misclassification in text categorization tasks.

Method: Mathematical collective decision-making model with principled aggregation of 10 LLMs under zero-shot conditions using IAB taxonomy.

Result: eLLM outperforms single models by up to 65% F1-score on 8,660 human-annotated samples, achieving near human-expert performance.

Conclusion: eLLM provides scalable, reliable taxonomy-based classification reducing dependence on human labeling while improving robustness and accuracy.

Abstract: This study introduces an ensemble framework for unstructured text categorization using large language models (LLMs). By integrating multiple models, the ensemble large language model (eLLM) framework addresses common weaknesses of individual systems, including inconsistency, hallucination, category inflation, and misclassification. The eLLM approach yields a substantial performance improvement of up to 65\% in F1-score over the strongest single model. We formalize the ensemble process through a mathematical model of collective decision-making and establish principled aggregation criteria. Using the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) hierarchical taxonomy, we evaluate ten state-of-the-art LLMs under identical zero-shot conditions on a human-annotated corpus of 8{,}660 samples. Results show that individual models plateau in performance due to the compression of semantically rich text into sparse categorical representations, while eLLM improves both robustness and accuracy. With a diverse consortium of models, eLLM achieves near human-expert-level performance, offering a scalable and reliable solution for taxonomy-based classification that may significantly reduce dependence on human expert labeling.

TL;DR: Graph-Memoized Reasoning is a framework that stores reasoning workflows as graphs for efficient reuse across tasks, reducing computation costs and improving reproducibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based systems waste resources by recomputing similar reasoning steps; need for persistent mechanisms to store and reuse prior computations.

Method: Encode past reasoning as decision graphs, retrieve them via structural/semantic similarity, enable compositional reuse of subgraphs.

Result: Framework provides optimization objective minimizing reasoning cost while maintaining consistency, with evaluation protocol.

Conclusion: Establishes foundation for interpretable, cost-efficient reasoning architectures with persistent memory in agentic systems.

Abstract: Modern large language model-based reasoning systems frequently recompute similar reasoning steps across tasks, wasting computational resources, inflating inference latency, and limiting reproducibility. These inefficiencies underscore the need for persistent reasoning mechanisms that can recall and reuse prior computational traces.
  We introduce Graph-Memoized Reasoning, a formal framework for representing, storing, and reusing reasoning workflows as graph-structured memory. By encoding past decision graphs and retrieving them through structural and semantic similarity, our approach enables compositional reuse of subgraphs across new reasoning tasks.
  We formulate an optimization objective that minimizes total reasoning cost regularized by inconsistency between stored and generated workflows, providing a theoretical foundation for efficiency-consistency trade-offs in intelligent systems. We outline a conceptual evaluation protocol aligned with the proposed optimization objective.
  This framework establishes the groundwork for interpretable, cost-efficient, and self-improving reasoning architectures, offering a step toward persistent memory in large-scale agentic systems.

Abstract: As Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning systems are used in safety critical applications. Understanding why agents make decisions and how they achieve collective behavior is crucial. Existing explainable AI methods struggle in multi agent settings. They fail to attribute collective outcomes to individuals, quantify emergent behaviors, or capture complex interactions. We present MACIE Multi Agent Causal Intelligence Explainer, a framework combining structural causal models, interventional counterfactuals, and Shapley values to provide comprehensive explanations. MACIE addresses three questions. First, each agent's causal contribution using interventional attribution scores. Second, system level emergent intelligence through synergy metrics separating collective effects from individual contributions. Third, actionable explanations using natural language narratives synthesizing causal insights. We evaluate MACIE across four MARL scenarios: cooperative, competitive, and mixed motive. Results show accurate outcome attribution, mean phi_i equals 5.07, standard deviation less than 0.05, detection of positive emergence in cooperative tasks, synergy index up to 0.461, and efficient computation, 0.79 seconds per dataset on CPU. MACIE uniquely combines causal rigor, emergence quantification, and multi agent support while remaining practical for real time use. This represents a step toward interpretable, trustworthy, and accountable multi agent AI.

### [17] [How Modality Shapes Perception and Reasoning: A Study of Error Propagation in ARC-AGI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15717)
*Bo Wen,Chen Wang,Erhan Bilal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了不同模态（文本与图像）如何影响AI模型在ARC-AGI任务中的感知和推理能力，发现结构化文本擅长坐标定位，图像擅长捕捉2D形状但受分辨率限制，结合两者可提升执行效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ARC-AGI任务旨在通过组合泛化衡量AI系统性推理能力，但现有方法缺乏对模态如何影响感知误差与执行误差的机理分析，需探究文本与图像编码如何形成感知瓶颈。

Method: 设计九种文本和图像模态，使用加权集合差异度量隔离感知与推理，采用两阶段推理流程（生成-执行-选择）测试不同模态下模型对网格特征的感知可靠性。

Result: 结构化文本在稀疏特征坐标定位上更精确；图像能捕获2D形状但对分辨率敏感；文本与图像结合提升执行效果（约8个感知点，中位相似度提高0.20）。

Conclusion: 使表征与Transformer归纳偏置对齐，并通过文本与图像的交叉验证，可在不改变模型的情况下提升指令准确性和执行可靠性。

Abstract: ARC-AGI and ARC-AGI-2 measure generalization-through-composition on small color-quantized grids, and their prize competitions make progress on these harder held-out tasks a meaningful proxy for systematic generalization. Recent instruction-first systems translate grids into concise natural-language or DSL rules executed in generate-execute-select loops, yet we lack a principled account of how encodings shape model perception and how to separate instruction errors from execution errors. We hypothesize that modality imposes perceptual bottlenecks -- text flattens 2D structure into 1D tokens while images preserve layout but can introduce patch-size aliasing -- thereby shaping which grid features are reliably perceived. To test this, we isolate perception from reasoning across nine text and image modalities using a weighted set-disagreement metric and a two-stage reasoning pipeline, finding that structured text yields precise coordinates on sparse features, images capture 2D shapes yet are resolution-sensitive, and combining them improves execution (about 8 perception points; about 0.20 median similarity). Overall, aligning representations with transformer inductive biases and enabling cross-validation between text and image yields more accurate instructions and more reliable execution without changing the underlying model.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ToolMind is a large-scale dataset of 160K synthetic and 200K augmented tool-agentic interactions with multi-agent simulation and turn-level validation to improve LLM agent training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing datasets that validate correctness only at trajectory level, which allows turn-level errors to propagate and degrade model performance.

Method: Constructs function graph based on parameter correlations, uses multi-agent framework for realistic user-assistant-tool interactions, and employs fine-grained turn-level filtering to remove errors.

Result: Models fine-tuned on ToolMind show significant improvements over baselines on several benchmarks.

Conclusion: ToolMind addresses data scarcity and quality issues in LLM agent training through sophisticated data synthesis and validation, leading to more robust tool-use capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have developed rapidly in recent years to solve complex real-world problems using external tools. However, the scarcity of high-quality trajectories still hinders the development of stronger LLM agents. Most existing works on multi-turn dialogue synthesis validate correctness only at the trajectory level, which may overlook turn-level errors that can propagate during training and degrade model performance. To address these limitations, we introduce ToolMind, a large-scale, high-quality tool-agentic dataset with 160k synthetic data instances generated using over 20k tools and 200k augmented open-source data instances. Our data synthesis pipeline first constructs a function graph based on parameter correlations and then uses a multi-agent framework to simulate realistic user-assistant-tool interactions. Beyond trajectory-level validation, we employ fine-grained turn-level filtering to remove erroneous or suboptimal steps, ensuring that only high-quality reasoning traces are retained. This approach mitigates error amplification during training while preserving self-corrective reasoning signals essential for robust tool-use learning. Models fine-tuned on ToolMind show significant improvements over baselines on several benchmarks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly using external web content. However, much of this content is not easily digestible by LLMs due to LLM-unfriendly formats and limitations of context length. To address this issue, we propose a method for generating general-purpose, information-dense summaries that act as plain-text repositories of web content. Inspired by Hegel's dialectical method, our approach, denoted as Chain of Summaries (CoS), iteratively refines an initial summary (thesis) by identifying its limitations through questioning (antithesis), leading to a general-purpose summary (synthesis) that can satisfy current and anticipate future information needs. Experiments on the TriviaQA, TruthfulQA, and SQUAD datasets demonstrate that CoS outperforms zero-shot LLM baselines by up to 66% and specialized summarization methods such as BRIO and PEGASUS by up to 27%. CoS-generated summaries yield higher Q&A performance compared to the source content, while requiring substantially fewer tokens and being agnostic to the specific downstream LLM. CoS thus resembles an appealing option for website maintainers to make their content more accessible for LLMs, while retaining possibilities for human oversight.

Abstract: This thesis explores a multimodal AI framework for enhancing construction safety through the combined analysis of textual and visual data. In safety-critical environments such as construction sites, accident data often exists in multiple formats, such as written reports, inspection records, and site imagery, making it challenging to synthesize hazards using traditional approaches. To address this, this thesis proposed a multimodal AI framework that combines text and image analysis to assist in identifying safety hazards on construction sites. Two case studies were consucted to evaluate the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) for automated hazard identification.The first case study introduces a hybrid pipeline that utilizes GPT 4o and GPT 4o mini to extract structured insights from a dataset of 28,000 OSHA accident reports (2000-2025). The second case study extends this investigation using Molmo 7B and Qwen2 VL 2B, lightweight, open-source VLMs. Using the public ConstructionSite10k dataset, the performance of the two models was evaluated on rule-level safety violation detection using natural language prompts. This experiment served as a cost-aware benchmark against proprietary models and allowed testing at scale with ground-truth labels. Despite their smaller size, Molmo 7B and Quen2 VL 2B showed competitive performance in certain prompt configurations, reinforcing the feasibility of low-resource multimodal systems for rule-aware safety monitoring.

TL;DR: This survey paper proposes a new taxonomy for spatial reasoning in AI based on cognitive aspects and reasoning complexity, rather than input modalities. It maps existing benchmarks to this framework and analyzes evaluation metrics and improvement methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current surveys categorize spatial reasoning progress by input modality, but spatial ability is not solely determined by input format. The authors argue for a cognitive perspective to enable more principled comparisons and reveal gaps between AI and human reasoning.

Method: The survey introduces a taxonomy organizing spatial intelligence from a cognitive aspect, dividing tasks by reasoning complexity and linking them to cognitive functions. It maps benchmarks across text-only, vision-language, and embodied settings to this taxonomy.

Result: The cognitive perspective reveals critical gaps between current model capabilities and human-like reasoning. The analysis clarifies strengths of both training-based and reasoning-based improvement approaches and uncovers complementary mechanisms.

Conclusion: This survey provides a comprehensive framework for understanding spatial reasoning in AI, offering researchers principled comparisons and actionable directions for future research to bridge the gap with human cognitive abilities.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning, which requires ability to perceive and manipulate spatial relationships in the 3D world, is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence, yet remains a persistent challenge for Multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While existing surveys often categorize recent progress based on input modality (e.g., text, image, video, or 3D), we argue that spatial ability is not solely determined by the input format. Instead, our survey introduces a taxonomy that organizes spatial intelligence from cognitive aspect and divides tasks in terms of reasoning complexity, linking them to several cognitive functions. We map existing benchmarks across text only, vision language, and embodied settings onto this taxonomy, and review evaluation metrics and methodologies for assessing spatial reasoning ability. This cognitive perspective enables more principled cross-task comparisons and reveals critical gaps between current model capabilities and human-like reasoning. In addition, we analyze methods for improving spatial ability, spanning both training-based and reasoning-based approaches. This dual perspective analysis clarifies their respective strengths, uncovers complementary mechanisms. By surveying tasks, benchmarks, and recent advances, we aim to provide new researchers with a comprehensive understanding of the field and actionable directions for future research.

Abstract: Multimodal learning systems often face substantial uncertainty due to noisy data, low-quality labels, and heterogeneous modality characteristics. These issues become especially critical in human-computer interaction settings, where data quality, semantic reliability, and annotation consistency vary across users and recording conditions. This thesis tackles these challenges by exploring uncertainty-resilient multimodal learning through consistency-guided cross-modal transfer. The central idea is to use cross-modal semantic consistency as a basis for robust representation learning. By projecting heterogeneous modalities into a shared latent space, the proposed framework mitigates modality gaps and uncovers structural relations that support uncertainty estimation and stable feature learning. Building on this foundation, the thesis investigates strategies to enhance semantic robustness, improve data efficiency, and reduce the impact of noise and imperfect supervision without relying on large, high-quality annotations. Experiments on multimodal affect-recognition benchmarks demonstrate that consistency-guided cross-modal transfer significantly improves model stability, discriminative ability, and robustness to noisy or incomplete supervision. Latent space analyses further show that the framework captures reliable cross-modal structure even under challenging conditions. Overall, this thesis offers a unified perspective on resilient multimodal learning by integrating uncertainty modeling, semantic alignment, and data-efficient supervision, providing practical insights for developing reliable and adaptive brain-computer interface systems.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a dual-module framework using RAG and Multi-Agent Systems to enhance LLM performance in biomechanics education, specifically for conceptual questions and multi-step calculation problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with domain-specific knowledge gaps and multi-step reasoning in complex subjects like biomechanics, limiting their effectiveness in specialized educational applications.

Method: A dual-module framework: 1) RAG for improving specificity in conceptual true/false questions, 2) MAS with multiple LLMs for solving calculation problems requiring equation derivation and code execution.

Result: RAG significantly improved LLM performance on conceptual questions, and MAS successfully handled multi-step reasoning and calculation tasks, demonstrating explainable solutions.

Conclusion: The integration of RAG and MAS shows strong potential for enhancing LLM performance in specialized engineering education, offering a promising approach for intelligent tutoring systems.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable versatility across a wide range of general tasks, their effectiveness often diminishes in domain-specific applications due to inherent knowledge gaps. Moreover, their performance typically declines when addressing complex problems that require multi-step reasoning and analysis. In response to these challenges, we propose leveraging both LLMs and AI agents to develop education assistants aimed at enhancing undergraduate learning in biomechanics courses that focus on analyzing the force and moment in the musculoskeletal system of the human body. To achieve our goal, we construct a dual-module framework to enhance LLM performance in biomechanics educational tasks: 1) we apply Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve the specificity and logical consistency of LLM's responses to the conceptual true/false questions; 2) we build a Multi-Agent System (MAS) to solve calculation-oriented problems involving multi-step reasoning and code execution. Specifically, we evaluate the performance of several LLMs, i.e., Qwen-1.0-32B, Qwen-2.5-32B, and Llama-70B, on a biomechanics dataset comprising 100 true/false conceptual questions and problems requiring equation derivation and calculation. Our results demonstrate that RAG significantly enhances the performance and stability of LLMs in answering conceptual questions, surpassing those of vanilla models. On the other hand, the MAS constructed using multiple LLMs demonstrates its ability to perform multi-step reasoning, derive equations, execute code, and generate explainable solutions for tasks that require calculation. These findings demonstrate the potential of applying RAG and MAS to enhance LLM performance for specialized courses in engineering curricula, providing a promising direction for developing intelligent tutoring in engineering education.

### [24] [Multi-Agent LLM Orchestration Achieves Deterministic, High-Quality Decision Support for Incident Response](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15755)
*Philip Drammeh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Multi-agent orchestration (MyAntFarm.ai) dramatically improves LLM-based incident response over single-agent approaches, achieving 100% actionable recommendations vs 1.7%, with 80x better specificity and 140x better correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-agent LLM approaches for incident response produce vague, unusable recommendations, limiting their practical utility in production systems.

Method: Comparison of 348 trials using a reproducible containerized framework (MyAntFarm.ai) testing single-agent copilot vs multi-agent systems on identical incident scenarios.

Result: Multi-agent systems achieved perfect actionable recommendation rate (100%), zero quality variance, and significant improvements in action specificity (80x) and solution correctness (140x), while maintaining similar latency (~40s) to single-agent approaches.

Conclusion: Multi-agent orchestration is essential for production-ready LLM-based incident response, providing deterministic quality that enables SLA commitments, rather than just a performance optimization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) promise to accelerate incident response in production systems, yet single-agent approaches generate vague, unusable recommendations. We present MyAntFarm.ai, a reproducible containerized framework demonstrating that multi-agent orchestration fundamentally transforms LLM-based incident response quality. Through 348 controlled trials comparing single-agent copilot versus multi-agent systems on identical incident scenarios, we find that multi-agent orchestration achieves 100% actionable recommendation rate versus 1.7% for single-agent approaches, an 80 times improvement in action specificity and 140 times improvement in solution correctness. Critically, multi-agent systems exhibit zero quality variance across all trials, enabling production SLA commitments impossible with inconsistent single-agent outputs. Both architectures achieve similar comprehension latency (approx.40s), establishing that the architectural value lies in deterministic quality, not speed. We introduce Decision Quality (DQ), a novel metric capturing validity, specificity, and correctness properties essential for operational deployment that existing LLM metrics do not address. These findings reframe multi-agent orchestration from a performance optimization to a production-readiness requirement for LLM-based incident response. All code, Docker configurations, and trial data are publicly available for reproduction.

Motivation: Address the challenge of extracting structured medical insights from unstructured clinical text in non-English contexts where NLP resources are scarce, using Polish EHR data.

Method: Comparative evaluation of low-compute rule-based methods and Large Language Models for extracting patient demographics, clinical findings, and medications from EHRs, including analysis of text normalization and translation effects.

Result: Rule-based methods achieved higher accuracy for age and sex extraction, while LLMs performed better in drug name recognition. Translation from Polish to English caused information loss affecting LLM performance.

Conclusion: Hybrid approaches combining rule-based precision with LLM adaptability offer the most practical solution for reliable and resource-efficient clinical NLP in real-world hospital settings.

Abstract: Extracting structured medical insights from unstructured clinical text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) remains an open challenge in healthcare, particularly in non-English contexts where resources are scarce. This study presents a comparative analysis of NLP low-compute rule-based methods and Large Language Models (LLMs) for information extraction from electronic health records (EHR) obtained from the Voivodeship Rehabilitation Hospital for Children in Ameryka, Poland. We evaluate both approaches by extracting patient demographics, clinical findings, and prescribed medications while examining the effects of lack of text normalisation and translation-induced information loss. Results demonstrate that rule-based methods provide higher accuracy in information retrieval tasks, particularly for age and sex extraction. However, LLMs offer greater adaptability and scalability, excelling in drug name recognition. The effectiveness of the LLMs was compared with texts originally in Polish and those translated into English, assessing the impact of translation. These findings highlight the trade-offs between accuracy, normalisation, and computational cost when deploying NLP in healthcare settings. We argue for hybrid approaches that combine the precision of rule-based systems with the adaptability of LLMs, offering a practical path toward more reliable and resource-efficient clinical NLP in real-world hospitals.

Result: 实验结果显示生成的电路在面积和功耗效率上显著优于传统HLS设计，接近人工设计质量。

Conclusion: 该框架有效结合了LLM的生成能力和传统IC设计流程的严谨性，展示了智能HDL设计的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in hardware front-end design using hardware description languages (HDLs). However, their inherent tendency toward hallucination often introduces functional errors into the generated HDL designs. To address this issue, we propose the framework CorrectHDL that leverages high-level synthesis (HLS) results as functional references to correct potential errors in LLM-generated HDL designs.The input to the proposed framework is a C/C++ program that specifies the target circuit's functionality. The program is provided to an LLM to directly generate an HDL design, whose syntax errors are repaired using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism. The functional correctness of the LLM-generated circuit is iteratively improved by comparing its simulated behavior with an HLS reference design produced by conventional HLS tools, which ensures the functional correctness of the result but can lead to suboptimal area and power efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that circuits generated by the proposed framework achieve significantly better area and power efficiency than conventional HLS designs and approach the quality of human-engineered circuits. Meanwhile, the correctness of the resulting HDL implementation is maintained, highlighting the effectiveness and potential of agentic HDL design leveraging the generative capabilities of LLMs and the rigor of traditional correctness-driven IC design flows.

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable success in text and vision domains through extended chain-of-thought deliberation. However, a perplexing phenomenon persists in audio language models: they consistently perform better with minimal or no reasoning, raising a fundamental question - can audio intelligence truly benefit from deliberate thinking? We introduce Step-Audio-R1, the first audio reasoning model that successfully unlocks reasoning capabilities in the audio domain. Through our proposed Modality-Grounded Reasoning Distillation (MGRD) framework, Step-Audio-R1 learns to generate audio-relevant reasoning chains that genuinely ground themselves in acoustic features rather than hallucinating disconnected deliberations. Our model exhibits strong audio reasoning capabilities, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Pro and achieving performance comparable to the state-of-the-art Gemini 3 Pro across comprehensive audio understanding and reasoning benchmarks spanning speech, environmental sounds, and music. These results demonstrate that reasoning is a transferable capability across modalities when appropriately anchored, transforming extended deliberation from a liability into a powerful asset for audio intelligence. By establishing the first successful audio reasoning model, Step-Audio-R1 opens new pathways toward building truly multimodal reasoning systems that think deeply across all sensory modalities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Steering LLM activations towards emotional processing improves Theory of Mind performance by enhancing emotional understanding while suppressing analytical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the internal mechanisms by which activation steering improves Theory of Mind in LLMs, specifically what cognitive processes are enhanced or suppressed.

Method: Used linear probes on 45 cognitive actions to compare activations of steered vs baseline Gemma-3-4B models on 1,000 BigToM scenarios with Contrastive Activation Addition steering.

Result: Improved belief attribution accuracy (32.5% to 46.7%) mediated by increased emotion perception (+2.23) and emotion valuing (+2.20), while suppressing questioning (-0.78) and convergent thinking (-1.59).

Conclusion: Successful ToM abilities in LLMs are driven by emotional understanding rather than analytical reasoning processes.

Abstract: Recent work shows activation steering substantially improves language models' Theory of Mind (ToM) (Bortoletto et al. 2024), yet the mechanisms of what changes occur internally that leads to different outputs remains unclear. We propose decomposing ToM in LLMs by comparing steered versus baseline LLMs' activations using linear probes trained on 45 cognitive actions. We applied Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) steering to Gemma-3-4B and evaluated it on 1,000 BigToM forward belief scenarios (Gandhi et al. 2023), we find improved performance on belief attribution tasks (32.5\% to 46.7\% accuracy) is mediated by activations processing emotional content : emotion perception (+2.23), emotion valuing (+2.20), while suppressing analytical processes: questioning (-0.78), convergent thinking (-1.59). This suggests that successful ToM abilities in LLMs are mediated by emotional understanding, not analytical reasoning.

Conclusion: The self-correcting framework effectively enhances reasoning faithfulness and accuracy in LLMs through real-time uncertainty monitoring.

Abstract: This project develops a self correcting framework for large language models (LLMs) that detects and mitigates hallucinations during multi-step reasoning. Rather than relying solely on final answer correctness, our approach leverages fine grained uncertainty signals: 1) self-assessed confidence alignment, and 2) token-level entropy spikes to detect unreliable and unfaithful reasoning in real time. We design a composite reward function that penalizes unjustified high confidence and entropy spikes, while encouraging stable and accurate reasoning trajectories. These signals guide a reinforcement learning (RL) policy that makes the model more introspective and shapes the model's generation behavior through confidence-aware reward feedback, improving not just outcome correctness but the coherence and faithfulness of their intermediate reasoning steps. Experiments show that our method improves both final answer accuracy and reasoning calibration, with ablations validating the individual contribution of each signal.

TL;DR: JudgeBoard是一个新颖的评估框架，直接查询模型评估答案正确性，无需额外答案比较，并通过多智能体协作提高SLMs的判断性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型语言模型在判断答案正确性方面能力不明确，现有LLM-as-a-judge框架依赖预定义指标进行间接比较，难以实现细粒度和可扩展的推理输出评估。

Method: 提出JudgeBoard评估流水线和MAJ（多智能体判断）框架，在数学推理和科学/常识推理领域构建任务特定评估排行榜，使用基于准确率的排名和Elo评分系统。

Result: 实验显示SLMs与LLMs在独立判断任务中存在显著性能差距，但MAJ框架显著提高了SLMs的可靠性和一致性，在MATH数据集上，使用较小模型的MAJ表现优于或与较大模型相当。

Conclusion: 多智能体SLM系统在判断任务中可能匹配或超越LLM性能，对可扩展和高效评估具有重要影响。

Abstract: While small language models (SLMs) have shown promise on various reasoning tasks, their ability to judge the correctness of answers remains unclear compared to large language models (LLMs). Prior work on LLM-as-a-judge frameworks typically relies on comparing candidate answers against ground-truth labels or other candidate answers using predefined metrics like entailment. However, this approach is inherently indirect and difficult to fully automate, offering limited support for fine-grained and scalable evaluation of reasoning outputs. In this work, we propose JudgeBoard, a novel evaluation pipeline that directly queries models to assess the correctness of candidate answers without requiring extra answer comparisons. We focus on two core reasoning domains: mathematical reasoning and science/commonsense reasoning, and construct task-specific evaluation leaderboards using both accuracy-based ranking and an Elo-based rating system across five benchmark datasets, enabling consistent model comparison as judges rather than comparators. To improve judgment performance in lightweight models, we propose MAJ (Multi-Agent Judging), a novel multi-agent evaluation framework that leverages multiple interacting SLMs with distinct reasoning profiles to approximate LLM-level judgment accuracy through collaborative deliberation. Experimental results reveal a significant performance gap between SLMs and LLMs in isolated judging tasks. However, our MAJ framework substantially improves the reliability and consistency of SLMs. On the MATH dataset, MAJ using smaller-sized models as backbones performs comparatively well or even better than their larger-sized counterparts. Our findings highlight that multi-agent SLM systems can potentially match or exceed LLM performance in judgment tasks, with implications for scalable and efficient assessment.

TL;DR: KRAL is a novel paradigm that enhances clinical LLMs through automated knowledge distillation, semi-supervised data augmentation, and agentic reinforcement learning, achieving superior performance at reduced costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of LLMs in clinical decision-making including knowledge gaps, privacy concerns, high costs, and limited reasoning capabilities.

Method: Uses teacher-model reasoning with answer-to-question generation, heuristic learning for data augmentation, and agentic reinforcement learning to enhance knowledge and reasoning efficiency.

Result: Outperforms RAG and SFT methods: Accuracy@1 on MEDQA increased by 1.8% vs. SFT and 3.6% vs. RAG; Pass@1 on PUMCH Antimicrobial increased by 27% vs. SFT and 27.2% vs. RAG.

Conclusion: KRAL is an effective, low-cost solution for enhancing local LLMs' clinical diagnostic capabilities, enabling safe deployment in complex medical decision support.

Abstract: Clinical antimicrobial therapy requires the dynamic integration of pathogen profiles, host factors, pharmacological properties of antimicrobials, and the severity of infection.This complexity imposes fundamental limitations on the applicability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes clinical decision-making including knowledge gaps, data privacy concerns, high deployment costs, and limited reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose KRAL (Knowledge and Reasoning Augmented Learning), a low-cost, scalable, privacy-preserving paradigm that leverages teacher-model reasoning to automatically distill knowledge and reasoning trajectories via answer-to-question reverse generation, employs heuristic learning for semi-supervised data augmentation (reducing manual annotation requirements by approximately 80%), and utilizes agentic reinforcement learning to jointly enhance medical knowledge and reasoning while optimizing computational and memory efficiency. A hierarchical evaluation employing diverse teacher-model proxies reduces assessment costs, while modular interface design facilitates seamless system updates. Experimental results demonstrate that KRAL significantly outperforms traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods. It improves knowledge question-answering capability (Accuracy@1 on the external open-source benchmark MEDQA increased by 1.8% vs. SFT and 3.6% vs. RAG) and reasoning capability (Pass@1 on the external benchmark PUMCH Antimicrobial increased by 27% vs. SFT and 27.2% vs. RAG), achieved at ~20% of SFT's long-term training costs. This establishes KRAL as an effective solution for enhancing local LLMs' clinical diagnostic capabilities, enabling low-cost, high-safety deployment in complex medical decision support.

TL;DR: The paper identifies a gap between information retrieval and reasoning in LLMs, particularly in clinical settings like Written Exposure Therapy (WET), and proposes an evaluation framework to measure reasoning quality alongside retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Even with access to correct evidence, LLMs often fail to reason correctly, which is especially problematic in clinical contexts where structured protocols must be followed precisely.

Method: The study evaluates model responses to clinician-vetted questions using WET guidelines as a testbed, analyzing performance even when authoritative sources are provided.

Result: Findings show persistent reasoning errors despite accurate retrieval. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) helps constrain outputs but doesn't eliminate reasoning flaws.

Conclusion: Safe deployment of LLMs in clinical settings requires evaluating reasoning (accuracy, consistency, fidelity) as rigorously as retrieval to bridge the gap between evidence access and correct application.

Abstract: Access to the right evidence does not guarantee that large language models (LLMs) will reason with it correctly. This gap between retrieval and reasoning is especially concerning in clinical settings, where outputs must align with structured protocols. We study this gap using Written Exposure Therapy (WET) guidelines as a testbed. In evaluating model responses to curated clinician-vetted questions, we find that errors persist even when authoritative passages are provided. To address this, we propose an evaluation framework that measures accuracy, consistency, and fidelity of reasoning. Our results highlight both the potential and the risks: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can constrain outputs, but safe deployment requires assessing reasoning as rigorously as retrieval.

MuseKG constructs a typed property graph linking objects, people, organisations, and visual or textual labels, and supports natural language queries. Evaluations on real museum collections demonstrate robust performance across queries over attributes, relations, and related entities, surpassing large-language-model zero-shot, few-shot and SPARQL prompt baselines. The results highlight the importance of symbolic grounding for interpretable and scalable cultural heritage reasoning, and pave the way for web-scale integration of digital heritage knowledge.

Result: 在近5000个实例上的实验显示，新模型在中小规模实例上表现优异，在最多500作业的大规模实例上比现有方法找到的解决方案好25%

Conclusion: 新约束规划模型在处理带有最小批次大小要求的序列批处理调度问题上优于现有方法，特别是在中小规模实例上表现突出

Abstract: In serial batch (s-batch) scheduling, jobs from similar families are grouped into batches and processed sequentially to avoid repetitive setups that are required when processing consecutive jobs of different families. Despite its large success in scheduling, only three Constraint Programming (CP) models have been proposed for this problem considering minimum batch sizes, which is a common requirement in many practical settings, including the ion implantation area in semiconductor manufacturing. These existing CP models rely on a predefined virtual set of possible batches that suffers from the curse of dimensionality and adds complexity to the problem. This paper proposes a novel CP model that does not rely on this virtual set. Instead, it uses key alignment parameters that allow it to reason directly on the sequences of same-family jobs scheduled on the machines, resulting in a more compact formulation. This new model is further improved by exploiting the problem's structure with tailored search phases and strengthened inference levels of the constraint propagators. The extensive computational experiments on nearly five thousand instances compare the proposed models against existing methods in the literature, including mixed-integer programming formulations, tabu search meta-heuristics, and CP approaches. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed models on small-to-medium instances with up to 100 jobs, and their ability to find solutions up to 25\% better than the ones produces by existing methods on large-scale instances with up to 500 jobs, 10 families, and 10 machines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reactive resource management using static thresholds leads to either resource overspending or performance degradation, highlighting the need for proactive solutions.

Method: Hybrid architecture embedding CNN-LSTM time series forecasts directly into the state space of a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning orchestrator.

Result: The system outperforms traditional methods, effectively handling complex multi-objective optimization (cost, performance, reliability) by anticipating future workload demands.

Conclusion: The proactive approach with integrated forecasting enables smoother, more efficient long-term resource planning, avoiding reactive problem-solving and optimizing the cost-performance trade-off.

Abstract: Old cloud edge workload resource management is too reactive. The problem with relying on static thresholds is that we are either overspending for more resources than needed or have reduced performance because of their lack. This is why we work on proactive solutions. A framework developed for it stops reacting to the problems but starts expecting them. We design a hybrid architecture, combining two powerful tools: the CNN LSTM model for time series forecasting and an orchestrator based on multi agent Deep Reinforcement Learning In fact the novelty is in how we combine them as we embed the predictive forecast from the CNN LSTM directly into the DRL agent state space. That is what makes the AI manager smarter it sees the future, which allows it to make better decisions about a long term plan for where to run tasks That means finding that sweet spot between how much money is saved while keeping the system healthy and apps fast for users That is we have given it eyes in order to see down the road so that it does not have to lurch from one problem to another it finds a smooth path forward Our tests show our system easily beats the old methods It is great at solving tough problems like making complex decisions and juggling multiple goals at once like being cheap fast and reliable

TL;DR: SkyRL-Agent is a framework for efficient multi-turn agent training with asynchronous dispatching and tool integration. It was used to train SA-SWE-32B, a software engineering agent that achieved 39.4% Pass@1 on SWE-Bench with 2x cost reduction.

Motivation: To address the need for efficient training and evaluation of long-horizon, multi-turn agents, particularly for complex tasks like software engineering.

Method: Uses an optimized asynchronous pipeline dispatcher (1.55x speedup) and AST-based search tool for code navigation. Trained SA-SWE-32B from Qwen3-32B purely with reinforcement learning.

Result: SA-SWE-32B achieved 39.4% Pass@1 on SWE-Bench Verified with >2x cost reduction. It also generalized well to other agentic tasks like Terminal-Bench and WebArena.

Conclusion: SkyRL-Agent provides an effective framework for efficient agent training, demonstrating strong performance on software engineering tasks and good generalization to other domains through its flexible architecture.

Abstract: We introduce SkyRL-Agent, a framework for efficient, multi-turn, long-horizon agent training and evaluation. It provides efficient asynchronous dispatching, lightweight tool integration, and flexible backend interoperability, enabling seamless use with existing RL frameworks such as SkyRL-train, VeRL, and Tinker.
  Using SkyRL-Agent, we train SA-SWE-32B, a software engineering agent trained from Qwen3-32B (24.4% Pass@1) purely with reinforcement learning. We introduce two key components: an optimized asynchronous pipeline dispatcher that achieves a 1.55x speedup over naive asynchronous batching, and a tool-enhanced training recipe leveraging an AST-based search tool to facilitate code navigation, boost rollout Pass@K, and improve training efficiency. Together, these optimizations enable SA-SWE-32B to reach 39.4% Pass@1 on SWE-Bench Verified with more than 2x cost reduction compared to prior models reaching similar performance. Despite being trained solely on SWE tasks, SA-SWE-32B generalizes effectively to other agentic tasks, including Terminal-Bench, BrowseComp-Plus, and WebArena. We further demonstrate SkyRL-Agent's extensibility through case studies on deep research, computer use, and memory agents, each trained using a different training backend.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in LLM clinical utility due to: 1) disconnect between static benchmarks and dynamic clinical needs, 2) difficulty adapting to evolving medical standards, 3) inability of conventional reward models to capture nuanced medical quality.

Method: Proposes MR-RML with GPRC: 1) Dimensions-Scenarios-Disciplines medical standard system, 2) independent multi-dimensional reward model for decomposed evaluation, 3) geometric projection reference constraints to transform medical logic into mathematical regularization.

Result: Substantial gains over Qwen-32B (45% on full subset, 85% on Hard subset of Healthbench). Achieves SOTA among open-source LLMs with scores of 62.7 (full) and 44.7 (hard), outperforming most closed-source models.

Conclusion: The framework effectively bridges critical alignment gaps in medical LLMs by structurally integrating clinical standards and cognitive logic into the training pipeline, demonstrating significant performance improvements.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into medical practice holds transformative potential, yet their real-world clinical utility remains limited by critical alignment challenges: (1) a disconnect between static evaluation benchmarks and dynamic clinical cognitive needs, (2) difficulties in adapting to evolving, multi-source medical standards, and (3) the inability of conventional reward models to capture nuanced, multi-dimensional medical quality criteria. To address these gaps, we propose MR-RML (Multidimensional Rubric-oriented Reward Model Learning) via GPRC (Geometric Projection Reference Constraints), a novel alignment framework that integrates medical standards into a structured "Dimensions-Scenarios-Disciplines" matrix to guide data generation and model optimization. MR-RML introduces three core innovations: (1) a "Dimensions-Scenarios-Disciplines" medical standard system that embeds domain standards into the full training pipeline; (2) an independent multi-dimensional reward model that decomposes evaluation criteria, shifting from real-time rubric-based scoring to internalized reward modeling for improved consistency and cost-efficiency; (3) geometric projection reference constraints that transform medical cognitive logic into mathematical regularization, aligning scoring gradients with clinical reasoning and enabling synthetic data-driven training. Through extensive evaluations on the authoritative medical benchmark Healthbench, our method yields substantial performance gains over the base LLM Qwen-32B (45% on the full subset and 85% on Hard subset, respectively). It achieves a SOTA among open-source LLMs with scores of 62.7 (full subset) and 44.7 (hard subset), while also outperforming the majority of closed-source models.

TL;DR: Introducing FOOTPASS - the first benchmark dataset for play-by-play action spotting in soccer matches that combines computer vision with tactical knowledge to automate annotation of structured game events.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current action recognition methods are insufficient for reliable play-by-play data extraction in soccer, creating a need for approaches that integrate tactical knowledge with computer vision predictions.

Method: FOOTPASS provides a multi-modal, multi-agent dataset enabling player-centric action spotting using computer vision outputs (tracking, identification) combined with soccer tactical knowledge over long time horizons.

Result: The dataset facilitates development of methods for generating reliable play-by-play data streams essential for sports analytics.

Conclusion: FOOTPASS enables more automated and reliable extraction of structured soccer event data by leveraging tactical knowledge as prior for computer-vision-based predictions.

Abstract: Soccer video understanding has motivated the creation of datasets for tasks such as temporal action localization, spatiotemporal action detection (STAD), or multiobject tracking (MOT). The annotation of structured sequences of events (who does what, when, and where) used for soccer analytics requires a holistic approach that integrates both STAD and MOT. However, current action recognition methods remain insufficient for constructing reliable play-by-play data and are typically used to assist rather than fully automate annotation. Parallel research has advanced tactical modeling, trajectory forecasting, and performance analysis, all grounded in game-state and play-by-play data. This motivates leveraging tactical knowledge as a prior to support computer-vision-based predictions, enabling more automated and reliable extraction of play-by-play data. We introduce Footovision Play-by-Play Action Spotting in Soccer Dataset (FOOTPASS), the first benchmark for play-by-play action spotting over entire soccer matches in a multi-modal, multi-agent tactical context. It enables the development of methods for player-centric action spotting that exploit both outputs from computer-vision tasks (e.g., tracking, identification) and prior knowledge of soccer, including its tactical regularities over long time horizons, to generate reliable play-by-play data streams. These streams form an essential input for data-driven sports analytics.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a shift from blind automation to explainable automated algorithm design using LLMs, focusing on understanding why algorithms work through systematic benchmarking and problem-class analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based automated algorithm design is performance-driven but opaque, lacking insight into why generated algorithms work, which components matter, or how design choices relate to problem structures.

Method: A three-pillar framework: 1) LLM-driven discovery of algorithmic variants, 2) explainable benchmarking that attributes performance to components and hyperparameters, 3) problem-class descriptors connecting algorithm behavior to landscape structure.

Result: The proposed approach forms a closed knowledge loop where discovery, explanation, and generalization reinforce each other, shifting from blind search to interpretable, class-specific algorithm design.

Conclusion: Integrating automation with understanding through systematic benchmarking will accelerate progress while producing reusable scientific insight into when and why optimization strategies succeed.

Abstract: Automated algorithm design is entering a new phase: Large Language Models can now generate full optimisation (meta)heuristics, explore vast design spaces and adapt through iterative feedback. Yet this rapid progress is largely performance-driven and opaque. Current LLM-based approaches rarely reveal why a generated algorithm works, which components matter or how design choices relate to underlying problem structures. This paper argues that the next breakthrough will come not from more automation, but from coupling automation with understanding from systematic benchmarking. We outline a vision for explainable automated algorithm design, built on three pillars: (i) LLM-driven discovery of algorithmic variants, (ii) explainable benchmarking that attributes performance to components and hyperparameters and (iii) problem-class descriptors that connect algorithm behaviour to landscape structure. Together, these elements form a closed knowledge loop in which discovery, explanation and generalisation reinforce each other. We argue that this integration will shift the field from blind search to interpretable, class-specific algorithm design, accelerating progress while producing reusable scientific insight into when and why optimisation strategies succeed.

Abstract: We present CRM (Multi-Agent Collaborative Reward Model), a framework that replaces a single black-box reward model with a coordinated team of specialist evaluators to improve robustness and interpretability in RLHF. Conventional reward models struggle to jointly optimize multiple, sometimes conflicting, preference dimensions (e.g., factuality, helpfulness, safety) and offer limited transparency into why a score is assigned. CRM addresses these issues by decomposing preference evaluation into domain-specific agents that each produce partial signals, alongside global evaluators such as ranker-based and embedding-similarity rewards. A centralized aggregator fuses these signals at each timestep, balancing factors like step-wise correctness, multi-agent agreement, and repetition penalties, yielding a single training reward compatible with standard RL pipelines. The policy is optimized with advantage-based updates (e.g., GAE), while a value model regresses to the aggregated reward, enabling multi-perspective reward shaping without requiring additional human annotations beyond those used to train the evaluators. To support training and assessment, we introduce rewardBench, a benchmark and training suite aligned with the collaborative structure of CRM. Together, CRM and rewardBench provide a practical, modular path to more transparent reward modeling and more stable optimization.

Abstract: Olympiad-level benchmarks in mathematics and physics are crucial testbeds for advanced AI reasoning, but chemistry, with its unique multimodal symbolic language, has remained an open challenge. We introduce ChemO, a new benchmark built from the International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO) 2025. ChemO features two key innovations for automated assessment: Assessment-Equivalent Reformulation (AER), which converts problems requiring visual outputs (e.g., drawing molecules) into computationally tractable formats, and Structured Visual Enhancement (SVE), a diagnostic mechanism to disentangle a model's visual perception capabilities from its core chemical reasoning. To tackle this benchmark, we propose ChemLabs, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that mimics human expert collaboration through specialized agents for problem decomposition, perception, reasoning, and auditing. Experiments on state-of-the-art multimodal models demonstrate that combining SVE with our multi-agent system yields dramatic performance gains. Our top configuration achieves a score of 93.6 out of 100, surpassing an estimated human gold medal threshold and establishing a new state-of-the-art in automated chemical problem-solving.

Motivation: Existing instruction-tuning datasets are costly and synthetic, while educational materials contain high-quality human-authored QAs that are underutilized due to PDF processing difficulties.

Method: Combines layout-aware OCR with LLM-based semantic parsing to automatically extract aligned QA/VQA pairs from educational documents while preserving semantic relationships.

Result: Produces accurate, aligned, low-noise QA/VQA pairs across diverse document types, enabling scalable use of real educational content for LLM training.

Conclusion: This approach offers practical alternative to synthetic data generation for improving reasoning-oriented LLM training, with open-sourced code and pipelines.

Abstract: The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly depends on high-quality supervised data, yet existing instruction-tuning and RL datasets remain costly to curate and often rely on synthetic samples that introduce hallucination and limited diversity. At the same time, textbooks and exercise materials contain abundant, high-quality human-authored Question-Answer(QA) content that remains underexploited due to the difficulty of transforming raw PDFs into AI-ready supervision. Although modern OCR and vision-language models can accurately parse document structure, their outputs lack the semantic alignment required for training. We propose an automated pipeline that extracts well-formed QA and visual-QA (VQA) pairs from educational documents by combining layout-aware OCR with LLM-based semantic parsing. Experiments across diverse document types show that the method produces accurate, aligned, and low-noise QA/VQA pairs. This approach enables scalable use of real-world educational content and provides a practical alternative to synthetic data generation for improving reasoning-oriented LLM training.

*Yun Lu,Xiaoyu Shi,Hong Xie,Chongjun Xia,Zhenhui Gong,Mingsheng Shang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文通过引入物品生命周期作为新变量，重新审视公平感知的交互式推荐系统。提出了LHRL框架，结合阶段检测和分层强化学习，在多个真实数据集上验证了其同时提升公平性和用户参与度的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前公平感知的交互推荐研究忽略了物品生命周期的动态影响。实证发现短视频平台物品生命周期呈现压缩的三阶段模式，与传统四阶段模型不同，这为公平性优化提供了新视角。

Method: 提出LHRL框架：1) PhaseFormer（轻量编码器，结合STL分解和注意力机制进行阶段检测）；2) 两级HRL智能体（高层策略施加阶段感知公平约束，底层策略优化即时用户参与）。

Result: 在多个人机交互推荐数据集上的实验表明，LHRL显著提升了公平性和用户参与度。将生命周期感知奖励集成到现有RL模型也能一致提升性能。

Conclusion: 物品生命周期是平衡推荐系统公平性与准确性的有效控制变量，LHRL框架具有良好的通用性和实用价值。

Abstract: This paper revisits fairness-aware interactive recommendation (e.g., TikTok, KuaiShou) by introducing a novel control knob, i.e., the lifecycle of items. We make threefold contributions. First, we conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis and uncover that item lifecycles in short-video platforms follow a compressed three-phase pattern, i.e., rapid growth, transient stability, and sharp decay, which significantly deviates from the classical four-stage model (introduction, growth, maturity, decline). Second, we introduce LHRL, a lifecycle-aware hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that dynamically harmonizes fairness and accuracy by leveraging phase-specific exposure dynamics. LHRL consists of two key components: (1) PhaseFormer, a lightweight encoder combining STL decomposition and attention mechanisms for robust phase detection; (2) a two-level HRL agent, where the high-level policy imposes phase-aware fairness constraints, and the low-level policy optimizes immediate user engagement. This decoupled optimization allows for effective reconciliation between long-term equity and short-term utility. Third, experiments on multiple real-world interactive recommendation datasets demonstrate that LHRL significantly improves both fairness and user engagement. Furthermore, the integration of lifecycle-aware rewards into existing RL-based models consistently yields performance gains, highlighting the generalizability and practical value of our approach.

*Zhiyuan Li,Haisheng Yu,Guangchuan Guo,Nan Zhou,Jiajun Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces MuISQA benchmark to evaluate RAG systems on multi-intent scientific questions, and proposes an intent-aware retrieval framework that improves evidence coverage and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional RAG systems struggle with multi-intent questions requiring evidence from diverse sources, leading to incomplete coverage.

Method: An intent-aware retrieval framework using LLMs to hypothesize answers, decompose queries, and retrieve/rank passages via RRF.

Result: The method outperforms conventional approaches on MuISQA and other RAG datasets, showing improved retrieval accuracy and evidence coverage.

Conclusion: The proposed intent-aware framework effectively addresses multi-intent scientific questions with better evidence aggregation.

Abstract: Complex scientific questions often entail multiple intents, such as identifying gene mutations and linking them to related diseases. These tasks require evidence from diverse sources and multi-hop reasoning, while conventional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are usually single-intent oriented, leading to incomplete evidence coverage. To assess this limitation, we introduce the Multi-Intent Scientific Question Answering (MuISQA) benchmark, which is designed to evaluate RAG systems on heterogeneous evidence coverage across sub-questions. In addition, we propose an intent-aware retrieval framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to hypothesize potential answers, decompose them into intent-specific queries, and retrieve supporting passages for each underlying intent. The retrieved fragments are then aggregated and re-ranked via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) to balance coverage across diverse intents while reducing redundancy. Experiments on both MuISQA benchmark and other general RAG datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms conventional approaches, particularly in retrieval accuracy and evidence coverage.

TL;DR: Proof-of-concept demonstration of agent-to-agent communication across distributed systems using natural-language messaging without shared identifiers, centralized data exchange, or structured schemas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how multiple organizations can cooperate securely via pseudonymised tokens and local data lookups while maintaining operational boundaries and privacy.

Method: Used Orpius platform for multi-agent orchestration with OperationRelay calls for natural-language communication. Agents (Clinic, Insurer, Specialist) operate on local data using HMAC-based pseudonymous tokens for secure information exchange.

Result: Successful demonstration of feasibility for distributed reasoning among specialized agents while keeping data local to each organization.

Conclusion: The prototype shows promising architectural patterns for privacy-preserving decentralized multi-agent systems, with opportunities for more rigorous evaluation and future research.

Abstract: This paper presents a proof-of-concept demonstration of agent-to-agent communication across distributed systems, using only natural-language messages and without shared identifiers, structured schemas, or centralised data exchange. The prototype explores how multiple organisations (represented here as a Clinic, Insurer, and Specialist Network) can cooperate securely via pseudonymised case tokens, local data lookups, and controlled operational boundaries.
  The system uses Orpius as the underlying platform for multi-agent orchestration, tool execution, and privacy-preserving communication. All agents communicate through OperationRelay calls, exchanging concise natural-language summaries. Each agent operates on its own data (such as synthetic clinic records, insurance enrolment tables, and clinical guidance extracts), and none receives or reconstructs patient identity. The Clinic computes an HMAC-based pseudonymous token, the Insurer evaluates coverage rules and consults the Specialist agent, and the Specialist returns an appropriateness recommendation.
  The goal of this prototype is intentionally limited: to demonstrate feasibility, not to provide a clinically validated, production-ready system. No clinician review was conducted, and no evaluation beyond basic functional runs was performed. The work highlights architectural patterns, privacy considerations, and communication flows that enable distributed reasoning among specialised agents while keeping data local to each organisation. We conclude by outlining opportunities for more rigorous evaluation and future research in decentralised multi-agent systems.

Motivation: Lack of transparent and reproducible data curation and training strategies in multimodal reasoning research hinders scalable progress.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) SFT stage with 874K-sample dataset for step-by-step validation, 2) RL stage with 74K-sample dataset across diverse domains to sharpen reasoning abilities.

Result: Significantly surpasses strong baselines, with 11.6% improvement over Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct across nine multimodal reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: The work establishes a solid empirical foundation for future large-scale multimodal reasoning research, highlighting the critical role of data quality and training design. All codes, pipeline, and data are open-sourced.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models have fueled growing interest in extending such capabilities to multimodal domains. However, despite notable progress in visual reasoning, the lack of transparent and reproducible data curation and training strategies remains a major barrier to scalable research. In this work, we introduce OpenMMReasoner, a fully transparent two-stage recipe for multimodal reasoning spanning supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we construct an 874K-sample cold-start dataset with rigorous step-by-step validation, providing a strong foundation for reasoning capabilities. The subsequent RL stage leverages a 74K-sample dataset across diverse domains to further sharpen and stabilize these abilities, resulting in a more robust and efficient learning process. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our training recipe not only surpasses strong baselines but also highlights the critical role of data quality and training design in shaping multimodal reasoning performance. Notably, our method achieves a 11.6% improvement over the Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct baseline across nine multimodal reasoning benchmarks, establishing a solid empirical foundation for future large-scale multimodal reasoning research. We open-sourced all our codes, pipeline, and data at https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/OpenMMReasoner.

*Jacopo Tagliabue,Federico Bianchi,Ciro Greco*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Bauplan is a new lakehouse architecture designed specifically for AI agents, offering transaction-based infrastructure with data and compute isolation to enable trustworthy agentic workflows in production environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional lakehouses are inadequate for AI agent access patterns, creating trust barriers that prevent enterprises from deploying agents on production data. The paper argues that solving infrastructure problems is the foundation for trustworthy agent workflows.

Method: The paper proposes Bauplan, an agent-first lakehouse design that reimplements data and compute isolation, drawing operational analogies to MVCC in databases but adapted for decoupled, multi-language environments.

Result: Bauplan enables seamless coupling of agent reasoning with correctness guarantees, demonstrated through a reference implementation of a self-healing pipeline that provides the necessary infrastructure for trustworthy agent operations.

Conclusion: By designing lakehouse infrastructure around transactions first, governance naturally follows, creating a path toward making AI agents trustworthy enough for enterprise production data workloads.

Abstract: Even as AI capabilities improve, most enterprises do not consider agents trustworthy enough to work on production data. In this paper, we argue that the path to trustworthy agentic workflows begins with solving the infrastructure problem first: traditional lakehouses are not suited for agent access patterns, but if we design one around transactions, governance follows. In particular, we draw an operational analogy to MVCC in databases and show why a direct transplant fails in a decoupled, multi-language setting. We then propose an agent-first design, Bauplan, that reimplements data and compute isolation in the lakehouse. We conclude by sharing a reference implementation of a self-healing pipeline in Bauplan, which seamlessly couples agent reasoning with all the desired guarantees for correctness and trust.

*Yan Chen,Yu Zou,Jialei Zeng,Haoran You,Xiaorui Zhou,Aixi Zhong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Pharos-ESG is a framework that converts unstructured ESG reports into structured formats using multimodal parsing, contextual narration, and hierarchical labeling to improve financial analysis and decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ESG reports are challenging to analyze due to chaotic layouts and unstructured content, requiring new methods for systematic processing.

Method: Integrates reading-order modeling, hierarchy-aware segmentation, and multimodal aggregation to transform visual elements into coherent natural language.

Result: Outperforms existing document parsing systems and multimodal models in experiments, with the release of the Aurora-ESG dataset.

Conclusion: Pharos-ESG effectively addresses ESG report analysis challenges and supports financial governance through structured data.

Abstract: Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles are reshaping the foundations of global financial gover- nance, transforming capital allocation architectures, regu- latory frameworks, and systemic risk coordination mecha- nisms. However, as the core medium for assessing corpo- rate ESG performance, the ESG reports present significant challenges for large-scale understanding, due to chaotic read- ing order from slide-like irregular layouts and implicit hier- archies arising from lengthy, weakly structured content. To address these challenges, we propose Pharos-ESG, a uni- fied framework that transforms ESG reports into structured representations through multimodal parsing, contextual nar- ration, and hierarchical labeling. It integrates a reading-order modeling module based on layout flow, hierarchy-aware seg- mentation guided by table-of-contents anchors, and a multi- modal aggregation pipeline that contextually transforms vi- sual elements into coherent natural language. The framework further enriches its outputs with ESG, GRI, and sentiment labels, yielding annotations aligned with the analytical de- mands of financial research. Extensive experiments on anno- tated benchmarks demonstrate that Pharos-ESG consistently outperforms both dedicated document parsing systems and general-purpose multimodal models. In addition, we release Aurora-ESG, the first large-scale public dataset of ESG re- ports, spanning Mainland China, Hong Kong, and U.S. mar- kets, featuring unified structured representations of multi- modal content, enriched with fine-grained layout and seman- tic annotations to better support ESG integration in financial governance and decision-making.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TOFA is a training-free one-shot federated adaptation framework for VLMs that uses visual and textual pipelines with adaptive weight calibration to handle data heterogeneity without requiring client or server training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of existing one-shot federated learning methods for VLMs, including insufficient multimodal exploitation, lack of specialized data heterogeneity handling, and additional training requirements.

Method: Combines visual pipeline with hierarchical Bayesian model for personalized prototypes and textual pipeline with prompt alignment, using adaptive weight calibration to balance modalities.

Result: Extensive experiments on 9 datasets show TOFA effectively adapts VLMs in various federated settings while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: TOFA provides an efficient, training-free solution for federated VLM adaptation that handles data heterogeneity while leveraging multimodal information effectively.

Abstract: Efficient and lightweight adaptation of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to downstream tasks through collaborative interactions between local clients and a central server is a rapidly emerging research topic in federated learning. Existing adaptation algorithms are typically trained iteratively, which incur significant communication costs and increase the susceptibility to potential attacks. Motivated by the one-shot federated training techniques that reduce client-server exchanges to a single round, developing a lightweight one-shot federated VLM adaptation method to alleviate these issues is particularly attractive. However, current one-shot approaches face certain challenges in adapting VLMs within federated settings: (1) insufficient exploitation of the rich multimodal information inherent in VLMs; (2) lack of specialized adaptation strategies to systematically handle the severe data heterogeneity; and (3) requiring additional training resource of clients or server. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel Training-free One-shot Federated Adaptation framework for VLMs, named TOFA. To fully leverage the generalizable multimodal features in pre-trained VLMs, TOFA employs both visual and textual pipelines to extract task-relevant representations. In the visual pipeline, a hierarchical Bayesian model learns personalized, class-specific prototype distributions. For the textual pipeline, TOFA evaluates and globally aligns the generated local text prompts for robustness. An adaptive weight calibration mechanism is also introduced to combine predictions from both modalities, balancing personalization and robustness to handle data heterogeneity. Our method is training-free, not relying on additional training resources on either the client or server side. Extensive experiments across 9 datasets in various federated settings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TOFA method.

*Claudius Gros*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues that neuroscientists should study generative AI principles (like those in diffusion models) and key ML concepts such as world modeling limitations, thought generation, attention mechanisms, neural scaling laws, and quantization to better understand brain function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent breakthroughs in generative AI are based on clear principles that could be operative in the brain. ML research provides valuable frameworks for understanding neural information processing that neuroscience could benefit from.

Method: The paper suggests a conceptual analysis and proposes investigating specific generative principles from ML (e.g., diffusion models) and key ML concepts by examining their potential relevance to cognitive neuroscience through theoretical comparison.

Result: Identification of five key ML areas (world modeling shortcomings, thought process generation, attention, neural scaling laws, quantization) as particularly promising for providing insights into brain function and advancing cognitive neuroscience.

Conclusion: Neuroscience should actively learn from contemporary ML research, as generative principles and characterizations from AI could fundamentally advance our understanding of neural computation and cognition.

Abstract: The big strides seen in generative AI are not based on somewhat obscure algorithms, but due to clearly defined generative principles. The resulting concrete implementations have proven themselves in large numbers of applications. We suggest that it is imperative to thoroughly investigate which of these generative principles may be operative also in the brain, and hence relevant for cognitive neuroscience. In addition, ML research led to a range of interesting characterizations of neural information processing systems. We discuss five examples, the shortcomings of world modelling, the generation of thought processes, attention, neural scaling laws, and quantization, that illustrate how much neuroscience could potentially learn from ML research.

*Joy Lai,Alex Mihailidis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces PersonaDrift, a synthetic benchmark to evaluate detection of progressive communication changes in dementia patients, simulating 60-day interactions with varying behavioral shifts like flattened sentiment and off-topic replies. Evaluates multiple ML methods, finding personalized approaches superior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing computational tools lack capability to track gradual behavioral drift in dementia patients' communication, which caregivers notice informally. Need for systematic evaluation framework.

Method: Creates synthetic interaction logs based on caregiver-informed personas. Injects progressive changes (flattened sentiment, semantic drift) at varying rates. Tests anomaly detection (CUSUM, EWMA), sequence models (GRU+BERT), and supervised classifiers in generalized vs. personalized settings.

Result: Flattened sentiment detectable with simple statistical models in low-variability users. Semantic drift requires temporal modeling and personalized baselines. Personalized classifiers consistently outperform generalized ones.

Conclusion: Personalized behavioral context is crucial for detecting communication drift in dementia. PersonaDrift provides extensible benchmark for future research.

Abstract: People living with dementia (PLwD) often show gradual shifts in how they communicate, becoming less expressive, more repetitive, or drifting off-topic in subtle ways. While caregivers may notice these changes informally, most computational tools are not designed to track such behavioral drift over time. This paper introduces PersonaDrift, a synthetic benchmark designed to evaluate machine learning and statistical methods for detecting progressive changes in daily communication, focusing on user responses to a digital reminder system. PersonaDrift simulates 60-day interaction logs for synthetic users modeled after real PLwD, based on interviews with caregivers. These caregiver-informed personas vary in tone, modality, and communication habits, enabling realistic diversity in behavior. The benchmark focuses on two forms of longitudinal change that caregivers highlighted as particularly salient: flattened sentiment (reduced emotional tone and verbosity) and off-topic replies (semantic drift). These changes are injected progressively at different rates to emulate naturalistic cognitive trajectories, and the framework is designed to be extensible to additional behaviors in future use cases. To explore this novel application space, we evaluate several anomaly detection approaches, unsupervised statistical methods (CUSUM, EWMA, One-Class SVM), sequence models using contextual embeddings (GRU + BERT), and supervised classifiers in both generalized and personalized settings. Preliminary results show that flattened sentiment can often be detected with simple statistical models in users with low baseline variability, while detecting semantic drift requires temporal modeling and personalized baselines. Across both tasks, personalized classifiers consistently outperform generalized ones, highlighting the importance of individual behavioral context.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床笔记富含详细的患者观察信息，是扩展医学本体的宝贵但未充分利用的资源，目前直接利用临床笔记进行本体扩展的研究仍较少。

Method: 基于大语言模型的零样本框架，自动提取医学实体并捕获复杂的层次关系，同时自动去除受保护的健康信息以保护患者隐私。

Result: 实验结果表明CLOZE能够准确、可扩展地扩展医学本体，且有效保护隐私。

Conclusion: CLOZE框架具有强大的潜力，可广泛应用于生物医学研究和临床信息学中的下游应用。

Abstract: Integrating novel medical concepts and relationships into existing ontologies can significantly enhance their coverage and utility for both biomedical research and clinical applications. Clinical notes, as unstructured documents rich with detailed patient observations, offer valuable context-specific insights and represent a promising yet underutilized source for ontology extension. Despite this potential, directly leveraging clinical notes for ontology extension remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose CLOZE, a novel framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to automatically extract medical entities from clinical notes and integrate them into hierarchical medical ontologies. By capitalizing on the strong language understanding and extensive biomedical knowledge of pre-trained LLMs, CLOZE effectively identifies disease-related concepts and captures complex hierarchical relationships. The zero-shot framework requires no additional training or labeled data, making it a cost-efficient solution. Furthermore, CLOZE ensures patient privacy through automated removal of protected health information (PHI). Experimental results demonstrate that CLOZE provides an accurate, scalable, and privacy-preserving ontology extension framework, with strong potential to support a wide range of downstream applications in biomedical research and clinical informatics.

Abstract: We develop a taxonomical framework for classifying challenges to the possibility of consciousness in digital artificial intelligence systems. This framework allows us to identify the level of granularity at which a given challenge is intended (the levels we propose correspond to Marr's levels) and to disambiguate its degree of force: is it a challenge to computational functionalism that leaves the possibility of digital consciousness open (degree 1), a practical challenge to digital consciousness that suggests improbability without claiming impossibility (degree 2), or an argument claiming that digital consciousness is strictly impossible (degree 3)? We apply this framework to 14 prominent examples from the scientific and philosophical literature. Our aim is not to take a side in the debate, but to provide structure and a tool for disambiguating between challenges to computational functionalism and challenges to digital consciousness, as well as between different ways of parsing such challenges.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: YOFO is a template-conditioned MLLM method that judges requirements in a single forward pass, providing fast, interpretable binary decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLM judging approaches face a trade-off between adaptation to scoring (misaligned with generative nature) and autoregressive analysis (too slow for high-throughput).

Method: YOFO uses a structured requirement template and reads the logits of the final token associated with each requirement to produce binary yes/no decisions in one inference step.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on standard recommendation datasets, with orders-of-magnitude speedups while preserving interpretability.

Conclusion: YOFO effectively balances speed and accuracy in MLLM-based judgment, supporting dependency-aware analysis and benefiting from post-hoc CoT.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show strong potential as judges. However, existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off: adapting MLLMs to output a single score misaligns with the generative nature of MLLMs and limits fine-grained requirement understanding, whereas autoregressively generating judging analyses is prohibitively slow in high-throughput settings. Observing that judgment reduces to verifying whether inputs satisfy a set of structured requirements, we propose YOFO, a template-conditioned method that judges all requirements in a single forward pass. Built on an autoregressive model, YOFO accepts a structured requirement template and, in one inference step, produces a binary yes/no decision for each requirement by reading the logits of the final token associated with that requirement. This design yields orders-of-magnitude speedups while preserving interpretability. Extensive experiments show that YOFO not only achieves state-of-the-art results on standard recommendation datasets, but also supports dependency-aware analysis-where subsequent judgments are conditioned on previous ones-and further benefits from post-hoc CoT.

TL;DR: Researchers propose Deliberate Practice Policy Optimization (DPPO), a metacognitive training framework that alternates between supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to efficiently train embodied AI systems with limited data. Their Pelican-VL 1.0 model shows significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses two major challenges in embodied intelligence: the scarcity of real-world training data and the inefficiency of current training methods that require excessive computational resources.

Method: DPPO is a 'Metaloop' framework that dynamically switches between supervised fine-tuning (for competence expansion) and reinforcement learning (for skill refinement), enabling automatic identification of weaknesses and targeted resource allocation.

Result: Training a vision-language embodied model with DPPO (Pelican-VL 1.0) achieved 20.3% improvement over the base model and outperformed open-source models at the 100B-parameter scale by 10.6%.

Conclusion: DPPO provides a systematic framework to alleviate data and resource bottlenecks in embodied AI, enabling more efficient development of versatile embodied agents. The authors are open-sourcing both models and code.

Abstract: Developing a universal and versatile embodied intelligence system presents two primary challenges: the critical embodied data bottleneck, where real-world data is scarce and expensive, and the algorithmic inefficiency of existing methods, which are resource-prohibitive. To address these limitations, we introduce Deliberate Practice Policy Optimization (DPPO), a metacognitive ``Metaloop'' training framework that dynamically alternates between supervised fine-tuning (competence expansion) and reinforcement learning (skill refinement). This enables automatic weakness identification and targeted resource allocation, specifically designed to maximize learning efficiency from sparse, finite data. Theoretically, DPPO can be formalised as a unified preference-learning framework. Empirically, training a vision-language embodied model with DPPO, referred to as Pelican-VL 1.0, yields a 20.3% performance improvement over the base model and surpasses open-source models at the 100B-parameter scale by 10.6%. We are open-sourcing both the models and code, providing the first systematic framework that alleviates the data and resource bottleneck and enables the community to build versatile embodied agents efficiently.

Motivation: 现有的Transformer模型在临床决策支持中容易过度自信，特别是在模糊的医疗案例中，校准的不确定性对于可靠预测至关重要。

Method: 框架包含三个组件：贝叶斯嵌入校准（使用蒙特卡洛dropout量化认知不确定性）、不确定性加权注意力（基于标记可靠性进行边缘化）和置信度引导决策塑造（受临床风险最小化启发）。

Result: 在生物医学QA和临床预测基准测试中，MedBayes-Lite持续改善校准和可信度，将过度自信降低32%至48%；在模拟临床环境中，通过标记不确定预测进行人工审查，可预防高达41%的诊断错误。

Abstract: We propose MedBayes-Lite, a lightweight Bayesian enhancement for transformer-based clinical language models designed to produce reliable, uncertainty-aware predictions. Although transformers show strong potential for clinical decision support, they remain prone to overconfidence, especially in ambiguous medical cases where calibrated uncertainty is critical. MedBayes-Lite embeds uncertainty quantification directly into existing transformer pipelines without any retraining or architectural rewiring, adding no new trainable layers and keeping parameter overhead under 3 percent. The framework integrates three components: (i) Bayesian Embedding Calibration using Monte Carlo dropout for epistemic uncertainty, (ii) Uncertainty-Weighted Attention that marginalizes over token reliability, and (iii) Confidence-Guided Decision Shaping inspired by clinical risk minimization. Across biomedical QA and clinical prediction benchmarks (MedQA, PubMedQA, MIMIC-III), MedBayes-Lite consistently improves calibration and trustworthiness, reducing overconfidence by 32 to 48 percent. In simulated clinical settings, it can prevent up to 41 percent of diagnostic errors by flagging uncertain predictions for human review. These results demonstrate its effectiveness in enabling reliable uncertainty propagation and improving interpretability in medical AI systems.

Abstract: This paper presents the implementation of an advanced artificial intelligence-based algorithmic trading system specifically designed for the EUR-USD pair within the high-frequency environment of the Forex market. The methodological approach centers on integrating a holistic set of input features: key fundamental macroeconomic variables (for example, Gross Domestic Product and Unemployment Rate) collected from both the Euro Zone and the United States, alongside a comprehensive suite of technical variables (including indicators, oscillators, Fibonacci levels, and price divergences). The performance of the resulting algorithm is evaluated using standard machine learning metrics to quantify predictive accuracy and backtesting simulations across historical data to assess trading profitability and risk. The study concludes with a comparative analysis to determine which class of input features, fundamental or technical, provides greater and more reliable predictive capacity for generating profitable trading signals.

Abstract: Large language models solve complex problems yet fail on simpler variants, suggesting they achieve correct outputs through mechanisms fundamentally different from human reasoning. We synthesize cognitive science research into a taxonomy of 28 cognitive elements spanning computational constraints, meta-cognitive controls, knowledge representations, and transformation operations, then analyze their behavioral manifestations in reasoning traces. We propose a fine-grained cognitive evaluation framework and conduct the first large-scale analysis of 170K traces from 17 models across text, vision, and audio modalities, alongside 54 human think-aloud traces, which we make publicly available. Our analysis reveals systematic structural differences: humans employ hierarchical nesting and meta-cognitive monitoring while models rely on shallow forward chaining, with divergence most pronounced on ill-structured problems. Meta-analysis of 1,598 LLM reasoning papers reveals the research community concentrates on easily quantifiable behaviors (sequential organization: 55%, decomposition: 60%) while neglecting meta-cognitive controls (self-awareness: 16%, evaluation: 8%) that correlate with success. Models possess behavioral repertoires associated with success but fail to deploy them spontaneously. Leveraging these patterns, we develop test-time reasoning guidance that automatically scaffold successful structures, improving performance by up to 60% on complex problems. By bridging cognitive science and LLM research, we establish a foundation for developing models that reason through principled cognitive mechanisms rather than brittle spurious reasoning shortcuts or memorization, opening new directions for both improving model capabilities and testing theories of human cognition at scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决结构健康监测中从稀疏数据恢复分布式机械参数时的病态性问题，传统确定性方法无法提供分辨率空间限制和固有不确定性的深入见解

Method: 使用贝叶斯反演框架，以识别分布式弯曲刚度作为主要案例研究，采用Fisher信息作为诊断指标来量化传感器信息量

Result: 在实际桥梁上的应用显示，贝叶斯方法能产生可信区间揭示实际不可识别区域，证明测量数据对目标参数具有高信息量但其效用具有空间异质性

Conclusion: 该框架将参数识别与不确定性量化统一起来，为优化传感器布置和解释健康监测诊断的可信度提供了严格基础

Abstract: In Structural Health Monitoring (SHM), the recovery of distributed mechanical parameters from sparse data is often ill-posed, raising critical questions about identifiability and the reliability of inferred states. While deterministic regularization methods such as Tikhonov stabilise the inversion, they provide little insight into the spatial limits of resolution or the inherent uncertainty of the solution. This paper presents a Bayesian inverse framework that rigorously quantifies these limits, using the identification of distributed flexural rigidity from rotation (tilt) influence lines as a primary case study. Fisher information is employed as a diagnostic metric to quantify sensor informativeness, revealing how specific sensor layouts and load paths constrain the recoverable spatial features of the parameter field.
  The methodology is applied to the full-scale openLAB research bridge (TU Dresden) using data from controlled vehicle passages. Beyond estimating the flexural rigidity profile, the Bayesian formulation produces credible intervals that expose regions of practical non-identifiability, which deterministic methods may obscure. The results demonstrate that while the measurement data carry high information content for the target parameters, their utility is spatially heterogeneous and strictly bounded by the experiment design. The proposed framework unifies identification with uncertainty quantification, providing a rigorous basis for optimising sensor placement and interpreting the credibility of SHM diagnostics.

TL;DR: RGym是一个面向Linux内核的轻量级程序修复评估框架，提出了基于专用定位技术的简单但有效的APR流程，在143个bug上测试达到了43.36%的修复率且每次修复成本低于0.20美元。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有APR基准主要关注用户空间应用，忽视了内核空间调试修复的复杂性，而Linux内核由于其单体内核结构、并发性和底层硬件交互带来了独特挑战。

Method: 构建RGym轻量级平台无关评估框架，使用专门定位技术（如调用栈和问题提交）避免不切实际的oracle使用，采用基于反馈的重试机制。

Result: 在143个经过筛选验证的bug上测试，使用GPT-5 Thinking模型达到最高43.36%的通过率，每次修复成本控制在0.20美元以内。消融研究展示了定位策略、提示结构和模型选择对性能的贡献。

Conclusion: RGym为内核空间APR提供了实用解决方案，反馈重试能显著提升成功率，证明了在低成本硬件上进行内核级程序修复的可行性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized automated program repair (APR) but current benchmarks like SWE-Bench predominantly focus on userspace applications and overlook the complexities of kernel-space debugging and repair. The Linux kernel poses unique challenges due to its monolithic structure, concurrency, and low-level hardware interactions. Prior efforts such as KGym and CrashFixer have highlighted the difficulty of APR in this domain, reporting low success rates or relying on costly and complex pipelines and pricey cloud infrastructure. In this work, we introduce RGym, a lightweight, platform-agnostic APR evaluation framework for the Linux kernel designed to operate on local commodity hardware. Built on RGym, we propose a simple yet effective APR pipeline leveraging specialized localization techniques (e.g., call stacks and blamed commits) to overcome the unrealistic usage of oracles in KGym. We test on a filtered and verified dataset of 143 bugs. Our method achieves up to a 43.36% pass rate with GPT-5 Thinking while maintaining a cost of under $0.20 per bug. We further conduct an ablation study to analyze contributions from our proposed localization strategy, prompt structure, and model choice, and demonstrate that feedback-based retries can significantly enhance success rates.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在软件工程中广泛应用，但其生成的代码常存在结构性质量问题，特别是代码坏味，目前缺乏对这些坏味如何及何时出现的清晰理解。

Method: 基于概率度量PSC（Propensity Smelly Score）评估生成特定坏味类型的可能性，并将其作为因果分析工具，研究生成策略、模型大小、架构和提示设计对代码结构的影响。

Result: 发现提示设计和架构选择对坏味倾向起决定性作用，提出的缓解策略能有效减少坏味出现；用户研究证明PSC有助于开发者理解模型行为和评估代码质量。

Conclusion: 本研究为将质量感知评估整合到代码生成大语言模型的评估和部署中奠定了基础，强调结构质量信号可支持人类判断。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have accelerated their adoption in software engineering contexts. However, concerns persist about the structural quality of the code they produce. In particular, LLMs often replicate poor coding practices, introducing code smells (i.e., patterns that hinder readability, maintainability, or design integrity). Although prior research has examined the detection or repair of smells, we still lack a clear understanding of how and when these issues emerge in generated code.
  This paper addresses this gap by systematically measuring, explaining and mitigating smell propensity in LLM-generated code. We build on the Propensity Smelly Score (PSC), a probabilistic metric that estimates the likelihood of generating particular smell types, and establish its robustness as a signal of structural quality. Using PSC as an instrument for causal analysis, we identify how generation strategy, model size, model architecture and prompt formulation shape the structural properties of generated code. Our findings show that prompt design and architectural choices play a decisive role in smell propensity and motivate practical mitigation strategies that reduce its occurrence. A user study further demonstrates that PSC helps developers interpret model behavior and assess code quality, providing evidence that smell propensity signals can support human judgement. Taken together, our work lays the groundwork for integrating quality-aware assessments into the evaluation and deployment of LLMs for code.

Method: 提出AI赋能的事件驱动编排框架,包含机器学习触发器、异常检测和流程挖掘分析

Result: 多组织案例显示在流程效率、成本可视化和决策准确性方面取得可衡量提升

Conclusion: 将AI能力嵌入Workday事件架构可增强运营韧性、治理和可扩展性,为医疗企业下一代自动化策略提供参考

Abstract: The adoption of cloud-based Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) platforms such as Workday has transformed healthcare operations by integrating financial, supply-chain, and workforce processes into a unified ecosystem. However, traditional workflow logic in ERP systems often lacks the adaptability required to manage event-driven and data-intensive healthcare environments.
  This study proposes an AI-enabled event-driven orchestration framework within Workday ERP that intelligently synchronizes financial and supply-chain workflows across distributed healthcare entities. The framework employs machine-learning triggers, anomaly detection, and process mining analytics to anticipate and automate responses to operational events such as inventory depletion, payment delays, or patient demand fluctuations. A multi-organization case analysis demonstrates measurable gains in process efficiency, cost visibility, and decision accuracy.
  Results confirm that embedding AI capabilities into Workday's event-based architecture enhances operational resilience, governance, and scalability. The proposed model contributes to the broader understanding of intelligent ERP integration and establishes a reference for next-generation automation strategies in healthcare enterprises.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality data annotation is crucial for safe and reliable AI systems in autonomous driving, but current requirements formulation and management face challenges like ambiguity and inconsistencies that impact system performance and safety.

Method: Conducted 19 semi-structured interviews with participants from 6 international companies and 4 research organizations, followed by thematic analysis to identify challenges and best practices.

Result: Identified five key challenges (ambiguity, edge case complexity, evolving requirements, inconsistencies, resource constraints) and three main best practice categories (ethical compliance, improved guidelines, embedded quality assurance).

Conclusion: This study provides the first empirically grounded guidance for improving annotation requirements, enhancing AI system reliability, and contributes to bridging Requirements Engineering and AI development.

Abstract: High-quality data annotation requirements are crucial for the development of safe and reliable AI-enabled perception systems (AIePS) in autonomous driving. Although these requirements play a vital role in reducing bias and enhancing performance, their formulation and management remain underexplored, leading to inconsistencies, safety risks, and regulatory concerns. Our study investigates how annotation requirements are defined and used in practice, the challenges in ensuring their quality, practitioner-recommended improvements, and their impact on AIePS development and performance. We conducted $19$ semi-structured interviews with participants from six international companies and four research organisations. Our thematic analysis reveals five main key challenges: ambiguity, edge case complexity, evolving requirements, inconsistencies, and resource constraints and three main categories of best practices, including ensuring compliance with ethical standards, improving data annotation requirements guidelines, and embedded quality assurance for data annotation requirements. We also uncover critical interrelationships between annotation requirements, annotation practices, annotated data quality, and AIePS performance and development, showing how requirement flaws propagate through the AIePS development pipeline. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to offer empirically grounded guidance on improving annotation requirements, offering actionable insights to enhance annotation quality, regulatory compliance, and system reliability. It also contributes to the emerging fields of Software Engineering (SE for AI) and Requirements Engineering (RE for AI) by bridging the gap between RE and AI in a timely and much-needed manner.

TL;DR: INFCODE-C++ is the first C++-aware autonomous system for repository-level issue resolution, combining semantic code-intent retrieval and AST-structured querying to achieve 25.58% resolution rate on MultiSWE-bench-CPP, outperforming previous agents by 10.85 percentage points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM agents for repository-level issue resolution are primarily designed for Python and perform poorly on C++ due to language-specific challenges like overloaded identifiers, nested namespaces, template instantiations, and complex control-flow structures.

Method: The system combines two complementary retrieval mechanisms: semantic code-intent retrieval and deterministic AST-structured querying to construct accurate, language-aware context for repair in C++ repositories.

Result: INFCODE-C++ achieves a 25.58% resolution rate on MultiSWE-bench-CPP benchmark, outperforming the strongest prior agent by 10.85 percentage points and more than doubling the performance of MSWE-agent.

Conclusion: The research highlights the critical need for language-aware reasoning in multi-language software agents and establishes a foundation for scalable, LLM-driven repair in complex, statically typed ecosystems like C++.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have recently shown strong performance on repository-level issue resolution, but existing systems are almost exclusively designed for Python and rely heavily on lexical retrieval and shallow code navigation. These approaches transfer poorly to C++ projects, where overloaded identifiers, nested namespaces, template instantiations, and deep control-flow structures make context retrieval and fault localization substantially more difficult. As a result, state-of-the-art Python-oriented agents show a drastic performance drop on the C++ subset of MultiSWE-bench. We introduce INFCODE-C++, the first C++-aware autonomous system for end-to-end issue resolution. The system combines two complementary retrieval mechanisms -- semantic code-intent retrieval and deterministic AST-structured querying -- to construct accurate, language-aware context for repair.These components enable precise localization and robust patch synthesis in large, statically typed C++ repositories. Evaluated on the \texttt{MultiSWE-bench-CPP} benchmark, INFCODE-C++ achieves a resolution rate of 25.58\%, outperforming the strongest prior agent by 10.85 percentage points and more than doubling the performance of MSWE-agent. Ablation and behavioral studies further demonstrate the critical role of semantic retrieval, structural analysis, and accurate reproduction in C++ issue resolution. INFCODE-C++ highlights the need for language-aware reasoning in multi-language software agents and establishes a foundation for future research on scalable, LLM-driven repair for complex, statically typed ecosystems.

Conclusion: 提出的框架能有效统一不同来源的TVD关键方面，显著改善漏洞描述的综合性和可用性，为安全分析提供更全面支持

Abstract: Textual Vulnerability Descriptions (TVDs) are crucial for security analysts to understand and address software vulnerabilities. However, the key aspect inconsistencies in TVDs from different repositories pose challenges for achieving a comprehensive understanding of vulnerabilities. Existing approaches aim to mitigate inconsistencies by aligning TVDs with external knowledge bases, but they often discard valuable information and fail to synthesize comprehensive representations. In this paper, we propose a domain-constrained LLM-based synthesis framework for unifying key aspects of TVDs. Our framework consists of three stages: 1) Extraction, guided by rule-based templates to ensure all critical details are captured; 2) Self-evaluation, using domain-specific anchor words to assess semantic variability across sources; and 3) Fusion, leveraging information entropy to reconcile inconsistencies and prioritize relevant details. This framework improves synthesis performance, increasing the F1 score for key aspect augmentation from 0.82 to 0.87, while enhancing comprehension and efficiency by over 30\%. We further develop Digest Labels, a practical tool for visualizing TVDs, which human evaluations show significantly boosts usability.

Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对LLM生成Solidity智能合约的关键功能（如gas消耗、安全性）和非功能属性的全面评估，需系统评估其可靠性。

Method: 对4个前沿LLM进行零样本和检索增强生成设置下的基准测试，使用代码相似度、语义嵌入、自动化测试、gas分析、认知和圈复杂度等多维度评估方法。

Result: LLM生成的代码语义相似度高但功能正确性低；代码更简单，复杂度和gas消耗显著更低；RAG显著提升功能正确性和代码效率。

Conclusion: LLM生成的智能合约在语义相似度和功能合理性存在显著差距；RAG是有效增强手段，但实现健壮的生产级代码生成仍是重大挑战，需专家验证。

Abstract: Smart Contracts are critical components of blockchain ecosystems, with Solidity as the dominant programming language. While LLMs excel at general-purpose code generation, the unique constraints of Smart Contracts, such as gas consumption, security, and determinism, raise open questions about the reliability of LLM-generated Solidity code. Existing studies lack a comprehensive evaluation of these critical functional and non-functional properties. We benchmark four state-of-the-art models under zero-shot and retrieval-augmented generation settings across 500 real-world functions. Our multi-faceted assessment employs code similarity metrics, semantic embeddings, automated test execution, gas profiling, and cognitive and cyclomatic complexity analysis. Results show that while LLMs produce code with high semantic similarity to real contracts, their functional correctness is low: only 20% to 26% of zero-shot generations behave identically to ground-truth implementations under testing. The generated code is consistently simpler, with significantly lower complexity and gas consumption, often due to omitted validation logic. Retrieval-Augmented Generation markedly improves performance, boosting functional correctness by up to 45% and yielding more concise and efficient code. Our findings reveal a significant gap between semantic similarity and functional plausibility in LLM-generated Smart Contracts. We conclude that while RAG is a powerful enhancer, achieving robust, production-ready code generation remains a substantial challenge, necessitating careful expert validation.

Abstract: Data annotation is essential but highly error-prone in the development of AI-enabled perception systems (AIePS) for automated driving, and its quality directly influences model performance, safety, and reliability. However, the industry lacks empirical insights into how annotation errors emerge and spread across the multi-organisational automotive supply chain. This study addresses this gap through a multi-organisation case study involving six companies and four research institutes across Europe and the UK. Based on 19 semi-structured interviews with 20 experts (50 hours of transcripts) and a six-phase thematic analysis, we develop a taxonomy of 18 recurring annotation error types across three data-quality dimensions: completeness (e.g., attribute omission, missing feedback loops, edge-case omissions, selection bias), accuracy (e.g., mislabelling, bounding-box inaccuracies, granularity mismatches, bias-driven errors), and consistency (e.g., inter-annotator disagreement, ambiguous instructions, misaligned hand-offs, cross-modality inconsistencies). The taxonomy was validated with industry practitioners, who reported its usefulness for root-cause analysis, supplier quality reviews, onboarding, and improving annotation guidelines. They described it as a failure-mode catalogue similar to FMEA. By conceptualising annotation quality as a lifecycle and supply-chain issue, this study contributes to SE4AI by offering a shared vocabulary, diagnostic toolset, and actionable guidance for building trustworthy AI-enabled perception systems.

Conclusion: 研究提供了确保OL-CAIS绿色恢复的模型、指标和策略，有效平衡了系统韧性和可持续性。

Abstract: Cyber-physical systems (CPS) combine computational and physical components. Online Collaborative AI System (OL-CAIS) is a type of CPS that learn online in collaboration with humans to achieve a common goal, which makes it vulnerable to disruptive events that degrade performance. Decision-makers must therefore restore performance while limiting energy impact, creating a trade-off between resilience and greenness. This research addresses how to balance these two properties in OL-CAIS. It aims to model resilience for automatic state detection, develop agent-based policies that optimize the greenness-resilience trade-off, and understand catastrophic forgetting to maintain performance consistency. We model OL-CAIS behavior through three operational states: steady, disruptive, and final. To support recovery during disruptions, we introduce the GResilience framework, which provides recovery strategies through multi-objective optimization (one-agent), game-theoretic decision-making (two-agent), and reinforcement learning (RL-agent). We also design a measurement framework to quantify resilience and greenness. Empirical evaluation uses real and simulated experiments with a collaborative robot learning object classification from human demonstrations. Results show that the resilience model captures performance transitions during disruptions, and that GResilience policies improve green recovery by shortening recovery time, stabilizing performance, and reducing human dependency. RL-agent policies achieve the strongest results, although with a marginal increase in CO2 emissions. We also observe catastrophic forgetting after repeated disruptions, while our policies help maintain steadiness. A comparison with containerized execution shows that containerization cuts CO2 emissions by half. Overall, this research provides models, metrics, and policies that ensure the green recovery of OL-CAIS.
