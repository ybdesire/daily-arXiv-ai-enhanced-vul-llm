### [1] [HD-Prot: A Protein Language Model for Joint Sequence-Structure Modeling with Continuous Structure Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15133)
*Yi Zhou,Haohao Qu,Yunqing Liu,Shanru Lin,Le Song,Wenqi Fan*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: HD-Prot is a hybrid diffusion protein language model that integrates continuous structural tokens with discrete sequence tokens using a unified diffusion framework, achieving state-of-the-art performance in various protein modeling tasks without the need for structural discretization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for integrating structural knowledge into protein language models often discretize protein structures, which results in loss of fine-grained information and limits multimodal pLM performance. The authors aim to develop a method that can incorporate continuous structural knowledge without the need for discretization.

Method: The paper proposes HD-Prot, a hybrid diffusion protein language model that embeds a continuous-valued diffusion head atop a discrete pLM. It uses a unified absorbing diffusion process to capture inter-token dependencies across modalities, with categorical prediction for sequences and continuous diffusion for structures.

Result: HD-Prot achieves competitive performance in unconditional sequence-structure co-generation, motif-scaffolding, protein structure prediction, and inverse folding tasks, performing on par with state-of-the-art multimodal pLMs despite limited computational resources.

Conclusion: HD-Prot demonstrates the viability of simultaneously modeling categorical and continuous distributions within a unified language model architecture, offering a promising alternative direction for multimodal protein language models that can achieve competitive performance even with limited computational resources.

Abstract: Proteins inherently possess a consistent sequence-structure duality. The abundance of protein sequence data, which can be readily represented as discrete tokens, has driven fruitful developments in protein language models (pLMs). A key remaining challenge, however, is how to effectively integrate continuous structural knowledge into pLMs. Current methods often discretize protein structures to accommodate the language modeling framework, which inevitably results in the loss of fine-grained information and limits the performance potential of multimodal pLMs. In this paper, we argue that such concerns can be circumvented: a sequence-based pLM can be extended to incorporate the structure modality through continuous tokens, i.e., high-fidelity protein structure latents that avoid vector quantization. Specifically, we propose a hybrid diffusion protein language model, HD-Prot, which embeds a continuous-valued diffusion head atop a discrete pLM, enabling seamless operation with both discrete and continuous tokens for joint sequence-structure modeling. It captures inter-token dependencies across modalities through a unified absorbing diffusion process, and estimates per-token distributions via categorical prediction for sequences and continuous diffusion for structures. Extensive empirical results show that HD-Prot achieves competitive performance in unconditional sequence-structure co-generation, motif-scaffolding, protein structure prediction, and inverse folding tasks, performing on par with state-of-the-art multimodal pLMs despite being developed under limited computational resources. It highlights the viability of simultaneously estimating categorical and continuous distributions within a unified language model architecture, offering a promising alternative direction for multimodal pLMs.

### [2] [Update Strategy for Channel Knowledge Map in Complex Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15154)
*Ting Wang,Chiya Zhang,Chang Liu,Zhuoyuan Hao,Rubing Han,Weizheng Zhang,Chunlong He*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: 论文提出Map Efficacy Function(MEF)框架解决CKM动态环境下的更新调度问题，开发了Delta-P和Delta-L算法，并推导出最优更新策略


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CKM在动态环境中预建地图会过时，频繁重训练恢复精度但造成显著浪费，存在CKM效能与更新开销的基本权衡

Method: 引入MEF捕获环境渐变和突变，将更新调度问题公式化为分式规划，开发两种Dinkelbach-based算法，推导阈值策略

Result: Delta-P保证全局最优性，Delta-L实现近最优性能和近线性复杂度；阈值策略确定立即更新或延迟更新的最优条件

Conclusion: 策略揭示强入口损耗和快速衰减偏好立即更新，弱入口损耗和慢衰减偏好延迟更新；可预测环境中长期策略可最大化全局性能

Abstract: The Channel Knowledge Map (CKM) maps position information to channel state information, leveraging environmental knowledge to reduce signaling overhead in sixth-generation networks. However, constructing a reliable CKM demands substantial data and computation, and in dynamic environments, a pre-built CKM becomes outdated, degrading performance. Frequent retraining restores accuracy but incurs significant waste, creating a fundamental trade-off between CKM efficacy and update overhead. To address this, we introduce a Map Efficacy Function (MEF) capturing both gradual aging and abrupt environmental transitions, and formulate the update scheduling problem as fractional programming. We develop two Dinkelbach-based algorithms: Delta-P guarantees global optimality, while Delta-L achieves near-optimal performance with near-linear complexity. For unpredictable environments, we derive a threshold-based policy: immediate updates are optimal when the environmental degradation rate exceeds the resource consumption acceleration; otherwise, delay is preferable. For predictable environments, long-term strategies strategically relax these myopic rules to maximize global performance. Across this regime, the policy reveals that stronger entry loss and faster decay favor immediate updates, while weaker entry loss and slower decay favor delayed updates.

### [3] [Nonparametric Stochastic Subspaces via the Bootstrap for Characterizing Model Error](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15624)
*Akash Yadav,Ruda Zhang*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: 提出基于 bootstrap 的随机子空间模型，用于计算力学中的模型误差表征


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工程中的可靠前向不确定性量化需要处理偶然和认知不确定性，模型误差直接影响模型可信度和预测可靠性

Method: 基于 bootstrap 的随机子空间方法，利用经验数据分布在主成分子空间上诱导采样分布

Result: 与现有方法相比，该方法能更好地表征计算力学中的模型误差

Conclusion: 该方法具有假设自由、能强制执行线性约束、只需一个超参数、算法易实现等优势

Abstract: Reliable forward uncertainty quantification in engineering requires methods that account for aleatory and epistemic uncertainties. In many applications, epistemic effects arising from uncertain parameters and model form dominate prediction error and strongly influence engineering decisions. Because distinguishing and representing each source separately is often infeasible, their combined effect is typically analyzed using a unified model-error framework. Model error directly affects model credibility and predictive reliability; yet its characterization remains challenging. To address this need, we introduce a bootstrap-based stochastic subspace model for characterizing model error in the stochastic reduced-order modeling framework. Given a snapshot matrix of state vectors, the method leverages the empirical data distribution to induce a sampling distribution over principal subspaces for reduced order modeling. The resulting stochastic model enables improved characterization of model error in computational mechanics compared with existing approaches. The method offers several advantages: (1) it is assumption-free and leverages the empirical data distribution; (2) it enforces linear constraints (such as boundary conditions) by construction; (3) it requires only one hyperparameter, significantly simplifying the training process; and (4) its algorithm is straightforward to implement. We evaluate the method's performance against existing approaches using numerical examples in computational mechanics and structural dynamics.

### [4] [How Deep Does Your Dependency Tree Go? An Empirical Study of Dependency Amplification Across 10 Package Ecosystems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14739)
*Jahidul Arafat*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 跨10个软件包生态系统的依赖放大实证研究显示Maven依赖放大最严重，挑战了npm放大率最高的假设，并揭示了生态系统设计选择对依赖放大的重要影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件包生态系统中依赖放大现象对软件供应链安全有重要影响，但跨生态系统的依赖放大模式尚未进行大规模比较研究。

Method: 对10个主要软件包生态系统中的500个项目进行实证研究，包括Maven Central、npm Registry、crates.io、PyPI、NuGet Gallery、RubyGems、Go Modules、Packagist、CocoaPods和Pub。

Result: Maven的平均依赖放大倍数最高（24.70倍），Go Modules为4.48倍，npm为4.32倍，CocoaPods最低为0.32倍。45对比较中有22对存在显著差异且效应量大。28%的Maven项目超过10倍放大，而Cargo、PyPI、Packagist、CocoaPods和Pub项目则没有超过10倍放大的情况。

Conclusion: 研究建议针对不同生态系统采用特定的安全策略，包括对Maven环境进行系统性审计，对npm和RubyGems进行有针对性的异常检测，以及对依赖放大控制较好的生态系统延续当前实践。

Abstract: Modern software development relies on package ecosystems where a single declared dependency can pull in many additional transitive packages. This dependency amplification, defined as the ratio of transitive to direct dependencies, has major implications for software supply chain security, yet amplification patterns across ecosystems have not been compared at scale. We present an empirical study of 500 projects across ten major ecosystems, including Maven Central for Java, npm Registry for JavaScript, crates io for Rust, PyPI for Python, NuGet Gallery for dot NET, RubyGems for Ruby, Go Modules for Go, Packagist for PHP, CocoaPods for Swift and Objective C, and Pub for Dart. Our analysis shows that Maven exhibits mean amplification of 24.70 times, compared to 4.48 times for Go Modules, 4.32 times for npm, and 0.32 times for CocoaPods. We find significant differences with large effect sizes in 22 of 45 pairwise comparisons, challenging the assumption that npm has the highest amplification due to its many small purpose packages. We observe that 28 percent of Maven projects exceed 10 times amplification, indicating a systematic pattern rather than isolated outliers, compared to 14 percent for RubyGems, 12 percent for npm, and zero percent for Cargo, PyPI, Packagist, CocoaPods, and Pub. We attribute these differences to ecosystem design choices such as dependency resolution behavior, standard library completeness, and platform constraints. Our findings suggest adopting ecosystem specific security strategies, including systematic auditing for Maven environments, targeted outlier detection for npm and RubyGems, and continuation of current practices for ecosystems with controlled amplification. We provide a full replication package with data and analysis scripts.

### [5] [VDMN: A Graphical Notation for Modelling Value Driver Trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14740)
*Benjamin Matthies*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces VDMN, a graphical notation for systematic Value Driver Tree modelling, addressing the lack of guidelines. Evaluation through case studies and expert interviews confirmed its utility for consistent VDT modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the increasing application of Value Driver Trees (VDTs), there are no systematic guidelines for modelling such conceptual models. This study aims to fill this gap.

Method: The study introduced the Value Driver Modelling Notation (VDMN), which includes a comprehensive set of semantic constructs and an intuitive graphical syntax. It was evaluated through two case studies and expert interviews.

Result: The results show that the VDMN supports consistent and comprehensible modelling of VDTs.

Conclusion: The VDMN represents a significant step towards the systematisation and standardisation of VDT modelling.

Abstract: Value Driver Trees (VDTs) are conceptual models used to illustrate and analyse the causal relationships between key performance indicators and business outcomes, thereby supporting managerial decision-making and value-based management. Despite their increasing application, there are still no systematic guidelines for the modelling of such conceptual models. To fill this gap, this study introduces the Value Driver Modelling Notation (VDMN), a graphical notation developed to systematically guide VDT modelling. This notation includes a comprehensive set of semantic constructs and an intuitive graphical syntax. To evaluate its practical utility, the VDMN was applied in two case studies and assessed through expert interviews. The results show that the notation supports a consistent and comprehensible modelling of VDTs. The VDMN thus represents a significant step towards the systematisation and standardisation of VDT modelling.

### [6] [Revisiting the Reliability of Language Models in Instruction-Following](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14754)
*Jianshuo Dong,Yutong Zhang,Yan Liu,Zhenyu Zhong,Tao Wei,Chao Zhang,Han Qiu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本研究揭示LLM在细微差别导向的可靠性方面存在严重缺陷，性能对提示的细微变化极为敏感，提出了新的评估方法和改进方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管先进LLM在IFEval等基准测试中实现了接近天花板的指令遵循准确率，但这些令人印象深刻的分数并不一定能转化为现实世界使用中的可靠服务，因为用户经常变化措辞、语境框架和任务表述。

Method: 引入了一个新指标reliable@k，并开发了一个通过数据增强生成高质量相似提示的自动化流程。在此基础上构建了IFEval++进行系统评估，涵盖了20个专有和26个开源LLM。

Result: 研究发现当前模型在细微差别导向的可靠性方面表现出显著不足，性能可能因细微提示修改而下降高达61.8%。研究还描述了该问题并探索了三种潜在的改进方案。

Conclusion: 当前模型在细微差别导向的可靠性方面存在显著不足，其性能可能因细微的提示修改而下降高达61.8%。研究提出了三种改进方案，并强调细微差别导向的可靠性是实现更可靠和可信赖LLM行为的关键但尚未充分探索的下一步。

Abstract: Advanced LLMs have achieved near-ceiling instruction-following accuracy on benchmarks such as IFEval. However, these impressive scores do not necessarily translate to reliable services in real-world use, where users often vary their phrasing, contextual framing, and task formulations. In this paper, we study nuance-oriented reliability: whether models exhibit consistent competence across cousin prompts that convey analogous user intents but with subtle nuances. To quantify this, we introduce a new metric, reliable@k, and develop an automated pipeline that generates high-quality cousin prompts via data augmentation. Building upon this, we construct IFEval++ for systematic evaluation. Across 20 proprietary and 26 open-source LLMs, we find that current models exhibit substantial insufficiency in nuance-oriented reliability -- their performance can drop by up to 61.8% with nuanced prompt modifications. What's more, we characterize it and explore three potential improvement recipes. Our findings highlight nuance-oriented reliability as a crucial yet underexplored next step toward more dependable and trustworthy LLM behavior. Our code and benchmark are accessible: https://github.com/jianshuod/IFEval-pp.

### [7] [Examining Software Developers' Needs for Privacy Enforcing Techniques: A survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14756)
*Ioanna Theophilou,Georgia M. Kapitsaki*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 开发者在实现数据隐私合规时面临挑战，研究表明开发者需要更多自动化工具支持隐私法规遵守。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据隐私立法使得隐私合规成为软件系统必备需求，但开发者缺乏相关法律知识，难以有效实施合规功能。

Method: 通过调查68名开发者，研究了影响从业者需求的各项因素。

Result: 大多数开发者表达了对更多自动化工具的需求，隐私经验越丰富的开发者对隐私工具的担忧越多。

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于开发者更好地定位隐私合规开发活动，并指出了对隐私促进工具的迫切需求。

Abstract: Data privacy legislation, such as GDPR and CCPA/CPRA, has rendered data privacy law compliance a requirement of all software systems. Developers need to implement various kinds of functionalities to cover law needs, including user rights and law principles. As data compliance is tightly coupled with legal knowledge, it is not always easy to perform such integrations in software systems. Prior studies have focused on developers' understanding of privacy principles, such as Privacy by Design, and have examined privacy techniques used in the software industry. Nevertheless, emerging developer needs that can assist in privacy law compliance have not been examined but are useful in understanding what development automation tools, such as Generative AI, need to cover to make the compliance process more straightforward and seamless within the development process. In this work, we present a survey that examines the above needs with the participation of 68 developers, while we have examined which factors affect practitioners' needs. Most developers express a need for more automated tools, while privacy experience increases practitioners' concerns for privacy tools. Our results can assist practitioners in better positioning their development activities within privacy law compliance and point to an urgent need for privacy facilitators.

### [8] [CAPE: Capability Achievement via Policy Execution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14761)
*David Ball*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出能力工程（Capability Engineering）和CAPE协议，通过将需求转换为可执行规范来系统化确保AI模型满足上下文依赖的约束，在多个领域显著降低违规率并降低成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代AI系统缺乏表达和执行需求的能力，预训练产生智能，后训练优化偏好，但都无法保证模型可靠地满足明确、上下文依赖的约束，导致智能模型在部署中经常失败。

Method: 引入能力工程实践，通过CAPE协议实现指定-验证-纠正-训练的循环，基于上下文客观性（固定上下文后主观属性变为客观）和验证-保真度缩放（验证准确性随模型规模提升）两个实证发现。

Result: 在6个领域的109,500个示例中，CAPE相对于DPO将违规率降低81%（标准差小于0.3%），通过可重用规范将成本降低5至20倍，时间从数月缩短到数周。

Conclusion: CAPE协议、PredicateGraph模式、CPL规范语言和政策包已发布，并推出CapabilityBench公共评估注册表，将评估从智能基准转向能力测量。

Abstract: Modern AI systems lack a way to express and enforce requirements. Pre-training produces intelligence, and post-training optimizes preferences, but neither guarantees that models reliably satisfy explicit, context-dependent constraints. This missing abstraction explains why highly intelligent models routinely fail in deployment despite strong benchmark performance.
  We introduce Capability Engineering, the systematic practice of converting requirements into executable specifications and training models to satisfy them by default. We operationalize this practice through CAPE (Capability Achievement via Policy Execution), a protocol implementing a Specify -> Verify -> Correct -> Train loop.
  CAPE is grounded in two empirical findings: (1) contextual objectivity, where properties appearing subjective become objective once context is fixed (inter-annotator agreement rises from kappa = 0.42 to kappa = 0.98), and (2) verification-fidelity scaling, where verification accuracy improves with model scale (r = 0.94), unlike preference agreement which plateaus at 30 to 50 percent disagreement regardless of compute. Across 109,500 examples in six domains, CAPE reduces violation rates by 81 percent relative to DPO (standard deviation less than 0.3 percent). By replacing per-example annotation with reusable specifications, CAPE reduces costs by 5 to 20 times and shortens timelines from months to weeks.
  We release the CAPE protocol, PredicateGraph schema, CPL specification language, and policy packs under Apache 2.0. We also launch CapabilityBench, a public registry of model evaluations against community-contributed policies, shifting evaluation from intelligence benchmarks toward capability measurement.

### [9] [Workflows vs Agents for Code Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14762)
*Henry Gray,Tom Yotam,Octavian Udrea*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Summary generation failed


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Translating algorithms from high-level languages like MATLAB to hardware description languages (HDLs) is a resource-intensive but necessary step for deployment on FPGAs and ASICs. While large language models (LLMs) offer a path to automation, their limited training on HDL code makes end-to-end transpilation brittle and prone to syntax errors. We compare two LLM-driven methods for syntax repair in a MATLAB-to-HDL pipeline: a structured, expert-designed flow that follows a fixed sequence of operations, and a more autonomous agentic approach that uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) \cite{anthropic2024mcp} to dynamically select its own tools. We study 42 MATLAB signal-processing functions and isolate the syntax-repair stage. Across three model scales, the agentic approach is more effective at resolving initial syntax errors, unblocking a greater number of candidates to proceed through the pipeline. This upstream improvement yields measurable downstream improvements, most notably on mid-sized models, where it increases the simulation reach rate by over 20 percentage points. We hypothesize the gains come from short prompts, aggressive context management, and conditional tool use. Conditional retrieval helps at 8B and 30B; at 235B final-success gains are small and a naive RAG variant attains the highest final success. Our findings suggest that these agentic frameworks, when properly designed, are most effective at compensating for the capacity limits of small and mid-sized models.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文介绍了AI驱动的系统研究（ADRS）范式，通过生成-评估-优化的迭代循环，在多个系统性能优化案例中展示了AI生成的解决方案可以媲美或超越人类专家设计，并提出了使用ADRS的最佳实践。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能正在通过自动化发现新解决方案来改变研究过程，这种转变依赖于可靠的验证器的可用性。专注于提高系统性能的研究特别适合这种范式，因为系统性能问题自然允许这样的验证器：候选方案可以在实际系统或模拟器中实现，并根据预定义的工作负载进行评估。

Method: 作者使用多个开源ADRS实例（如OpenEvolve、GEPA和ShinkaEvolve），在十个案例研究（如多云区域调度、专家混合负载均衡、基于LLM的SQL、事务调度）中进行了评估。

Result: ADRS生成的解决方案可以匹配甚至超越人类最先进的设计。基于这些发现，作者概述了有效使用ADRS的最佳实践（如提示规范级别、反馈量、稳健评估），并讨论了未来的研究方向和影响。

Conclusion: 尽管目前还没有一个通用的方法将ADRS应用于所有系统研究领域，但作者希望他们的初步发现和识别出的挑战能为未来研究提供有意义的指导，因为研究人员的工作重心正逐渐转向问题制定和战略监督。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is beginning to transform the research process by automating the discovery of new solutions. This shift depends on the availability of reliable verifiers, which AI-driven approaches require to validate candidate solutions. Research focused on improving systems performance is especially well-suited to this paradigm because system performance problems naturally admit such verifiers: candidates can be implemented in real systems or simulators and evaluated against predefined workloads. We term this iterative cycle of generation, evaluation, and refinement AI-Driven Research for Systems (ADRS). Using several open-source ADRS instances (i.e., OpenEvolve, GEPA, and ShinkaEvolve), we demonstrate across ten case studies (e.g., multi-region cloud scheduling, mixture-of-experts load balancing, LLM-based SQL, transaction scheduling) that ADRS-generated solutions can match or even outperform human state-of-the-art designs. Based on these findings, we outline best practices (e.g., level of prompt specification, amount of feedback, robust evaluation) for effectively using ADRS, and we discuss future research directions and their implications. Although we do not yet have a universal recipe for applying ADRS across all of systems research, we hope our preliminary findings, together with the challenges we identify, offer meaningful guidance for future work as researcher effort shifts increasingly toward problem formulation and strategic oversight. Note: This paper is an extension of our prior work [14]. It adds extensive evaluation across multiple ADRS frameworks and provides deeper analysis and insights into best practices.

*Changshu Liu,Alireza Ghazanfari,Yang Chen,Reyhaneh Jabbarvand*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了RE2-Bench基准测试，包含1101个推理问题，用于更真实地评估大语言模型的代码推理能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试使用简单程序，无法代表真实世界的代码复杂性，导致对大语言模型推理能力的评估存在偏差

Method: 利用静态和动态程序分析自动序列化和反序列化真实世界代码中的复合类型，通过基于9个可解释代码复杂度指标的多数投票机制将问题分类为易/难

Result: 对6个大语言模型的评估显示，从易到难问题性能显著下降（输入预测下降51.50%，输出预测下降42.15%）

Conclusion: 现有评估显著高估了大语言模型的代码推理能力，RE2-Bench提供了更真实的评估框架

Abstract: Code reasoning tasks are becoming prevalent in large language model (LLM) assessments. Existing benchmarks involve simple programs, failing to represent real-world complexities such as inter- or intra-procedural dependencies, core or third-party API calls, highly nested constructs, and non-primitive complex types. Evaluating LLMs under such a simplistic setting poses a significant threat to assumptions about their generalizability in practice. To enable a more realistic evaluation of code reasoning, this paper proposes RE2-Bench, a benchmark of 1,101 reasoning problems, including 195 drawn from mature real-world projects. RE2-Bench leverages static and dynamic program analysis to automatically serialize and deserialize compound, complex, and custom types in real-world code, going far beyond the primitive-only settings used in prior work.
  A key feature of RE2-Bench is categorizing each reasoning problem as Easy or Hard via a principled majority-vote mechanism over nine interpretable code complexity metrics, resulting in two well-separated and semantically meaningful difficulty categories suitable for precise calibration of LLM reasoning ability. A comprehensive evaluation of six general-purpose and reasoning-oriented LLMs on two widely used code reasoning tasks -- input prediction and output prediction -- using RE2-Bench reveals a significant performance drop from Easy to Hard problems (51.50\% for input prediction and 42.15\% for output prediction), confirming that prior evaluations substantially overestimate the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为RepGen的自动化智能方法，用于复现深度学习bug，通过结合学习和迭代机制，在106个真实bug上实现了80.19%的复现率，相比现有技术提高了19.81%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习应用广泛但存在大量bug，由于模型的非确定性和软硬件环境耦合，手动复现率仅为3%，亟需高效的自动化解决方案。

Method: RepGen方法包含构建项目的学习增强上下文、制定综合复现计划、采用迭代的生成-验证-优化机制，并使用LLM生成复现代码。

Result: 在106个真实深度学习bug上测试，RepGen达到80.19%的复现率，开发者研究显示成功率和效率显著提升，认知负荷降低。

Conclusion: RepGen有效解决了深度学习bug复现的挑战，显著优于现有方法，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Despite their wide adoption in various domains (e.g., healthcare, finance, software engineering), Deep Learning (DL)-based applications suffer from many bugs, failures, and vulnerabilities. Reproducing these bugs is essential for their resolution, but it is extremely challenging due to the inherent nondeterminism of DL models and their tight coupling with hardware and software environments. According to recent studies, only about 3% of DL bugs can be reliably reproduced using manual approaches. To address these challenges, we present RepGen, a novel, automated, and intelligent approach for reproducing deep learning bugs. RepGen constructs a learning-enhanced context from a project, develops a comprehensive plan for bug reproduction, employs an iterative generate-validate-refine mechanism, and thus generates such code using an LLM that reproduces the bug at hand. We evaluate RepGen on 106 real-world deep learning bugs and achieve a reproduction rate of 80.19%, a 19.81% improvement over the state-of-the-art measure. A developer study involving 27 participants shows that RepGen improves the success rate of DL bug reproduction by 23.35%, reduces the time to reproduce by 56.8%, and lowers participants' cognitive load.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于LLM的框架，通过两步提示流程预测GitHub对话脱轨，在开源软件社区中实现了高效的毒性对话早期检测，显著优于传统NLP方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源软件（OSS）社区中的有害互动会减少贡献者参与度并威胁项目可持续性，而现有的主动审核策略多为手动操作，需要社区维护者投入大量时间和精力。

Method: 开发了一种新颖的基于大型语言模型（LLM）的框架，采用两步提示流程：首先通过Least-to-Most（LtM）提示生成对话动态摘要（SCDs），然后利用这些摘要来估计对话脱轨的可能性。在Qwen和Llama模型上进行了评估。

Result: LtM策略在决策阈值为0.3时，Qwen和Llama模型的F1分数分别达到0.901和0.852，优于现有的NLP基线方法。在包含308个GitHub问题线程（65个有毒，243个无毒）的外部验证数据集上，F1分数最高达到0.797。

Conclusion: LLM-based框架通过两步提示流程在GitHub对话脱轨预测中表现出色，为OSS社区提供了可扩展且可解释的主动审核方法，证明了结构化提示在早期检测对话脱轨方面的有效性。

Abstract: Toxic interactions in Open Source Software (OSS) communities reduce contributor engagement and threaten project sustainability. Preventing such toxicity before it emerges requires a clear understanding of how harmful conversations unfold. However, most proactive moderation strategies are manual, requiring significant time and effort from community maintainers. To support more scalable approaches, we curate a dataset of 159 derailed toxic threads and 207 non-toxic threads from GitHub discussions. Our analysis reveals that toxicity can be forecast by tension triggers, sentiment shifts, and specific conversational patterns.
  We present a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based framework for predicting conversational derailment on GitHub using a two-step prompting pipeline. First, we generate \textit{Summaries of Conversation Dynamics} (SCDs) via Least-to-Most (LtM) prompting; then we use these summaries to estimate the \textit{likelihood of derailment}. Evaluated on Qwen and Llama models, our LtM strategy achieves F1-scores of 0.901 and 0.852, respectively, at a decision threshold of 0.3, outperforming established NLP baselines on conversation derailment. External validation on a dataset of 308 GitHub issue threads (65 toxic, 243 non-toxic) yields an F1-score up to 0.797. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of structured LLM prompting for early detection of conversational derailment in OSS, enabling proactive and explainable moderation.

Result: 识别出七大关键启示：软件需求与架构的挑战、智能SE方法的可靠性与可解释性、学术研究的输入假设、实践评估矛盾以及伦理考量

Conclusion: 研究旨在重新引导学术界关注这些重要但未被充分探索的问题，指导未来SE研究实现更大的工业影响力

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) is fundamentally reshaping software engineering (SE), driving a paradigm shift in both academic research and industrial practice. While top-tier SE venues continue to show sustained or emerging focus on areas like automated testing and program repair, with researchers worldwide reporting continuous performance gains, the alignment of these academic advances with real industrial needs remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we first conduct a systematic analysis of 1,367 papers published in FSE, ASE, and ICSE between 2022 and 2025, identifying key research topics, commonly used benchmarks, industrial relevance, and open-source availability. We then carry out an empirical survey across 17 organizations, collecting 282 responses on six prominent topics, i.e., program analysis, automated testing, code generation/completion, issue resolution, pre-trained code models, and dependency management, through structured questionnaires. By contrasting academic capabilities with industrial feedback, we derive seven critical implications, highlighting under-addressed challenges in software requirements and architecture, the reliability and explainability of intelligent SE approaches, input assumptions in academic research, practical evaluation tensions, and ethical considerations. This study aims to refocus academic attention on these important yet under-explored problems and to guide future SE research toward greater industrial impact.

*Giuseppe Della Penna,Igor Melatti*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出BDTransTest工具，将BPMN+DMN流程转换为Java程序并自动生成测试计划，解决现有工具只能检测语法错误的问题，通过实验验证了方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前BPMN+DMN建模框架仅能检测语法错误，忽略了语义（行为）错误，迫使设计者手动运行流程来检测故障，且专有工具的转换方法不透明。

Method: 设计了一个名为BDTransTest的工具，实现：1）BPMN+DMN流程到Java程序的转换；2）测试计划的合成与执行，可能需要设计者消除输入域歧义；3）基于流程节点和边的覆盖率分析测试计划。

Result: 对文献中的BPMN+DMN流程进行了实验评估，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: BDTransTest工具通过将BPMN+DMN流程转换为Java程序并进行测试计划分析，有效解决了当前工具只能检测语法错误而忽略语义错误的局限，为业务流程设计者提供了自动化的语义验证能力。

Abstract: The increasing and widespread use of BPMN business processes, also embodying DMN tables, requires tools and methodologies to verify their correctness. However, most commonly used frameworks to build BPMN+DMN models only allow designers to detect syntactical errors, thus ignoring semantic (behavioural) faults. This forces business processes designers to manually run single executions of their BPMN+DMN processes using proprietary tools in order to detect failures. Furthermore, how proprietary tools translate a BPMN+DMN process to a computer simulation is left unspecified. In this paper, we advance this state of the art by designing a tool, named BDTransTest providing: i) a translation from a BPMN + DMN process B to a Java program P ; ii) the synthesis and execution of a testing plan for B, that may require the business designer to disambiguate some input domain; iii) the analysis of the coverage achieved by the testing plan in terms of nodes and edges of B. Finally, we provide an experimental evaluation of our methodology on BPMN+DMN processes from the literature.

*Faima Abbasi,Jean-Sébastien Sottet,Cedric Pruski*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于多层数字孪生的异构模型对齐框架，结合自适应一致性机制和LLM验证的对齐过程，以解决跨抽象层的语义不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多层数字孪生中异构模型对齐方法依赖静态映射和手动更新，导致不灵活、易出错和数据完整性问题。

Method: 开发了一个包含自适应一致性机制（链接元模型与演化模型）和LLM验证对齐过程（基于领域知识锚定元模型）的框架。

Result: 该方法自动发现语义对应关系，减少手动映射，提高跨模型类型的可扩展性，并通过空气质量用例和OAEI测试案例验证。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架增强了数字孪生中异构模型对齐的自动化程度、语义一致性和生命周期管理能力。

Abstract: Digital twin (DT) technology integrates heterogeneous data and models, along with semantic technologies to create multi-layered digital representation of physical systems. DTs enable monitoring, simulation, prediction, and optimization to enhance decision making and operational efficiency. A key challenge in multi-layered, model-driven DTs is aligning heterogeneous models across abstraction layers, which can lead to semantic mismatches, inconsistencies, and synchronization issues. Existing methods, relying on static mappings and manual updates, are often inflexible, error-prone, and risk compromising data integrity. To address these limitations, we present a heterogeneous model alignment approach for multi-layered, model-driven DTs. The framework incorporates a flexibility mechanism that allows metamodels to adapt and interconnect seamlessly while maintaining semantic coherence across abstraction layers. It integrates: (i) adaptive conformance mechanisms that link metamodels with evolving models and (ii) a large language model (LLM) validated alignment process that grounds metamodels in domain knowledge, ensuring structural fidelity and conceptual consistency throughout the DT lifecycle. This approach automates semantic correspondences discovery, minimizes manual mapping, and enhances scalability across diverse model types. We illustrate the approach using air quality use case and validate its performance using different test cases from Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) tracks.

Method: 通过系统文献综述分析31篇主要研究和10篇综述（2015-2025），重点评估生成模型（LLM、GAN、扩散模型等）在多模态场景合成中的应用

Result: 识别出三大研究空白：标准化评估指标缺失、伦理因素整合不足、多模态场景覆盖不充分

Conclusion: 提出包含多模态扩展的分类法、伦理安全清单和ODD覆盖图谱，为行业提供可复现的评估基准

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and reliability of Automated Driving Systems (ADS) remains a critical challenge, as traditional verification methods such as large-scale on-road testing are prohibitively costly and time-consuming.To address this,scenario-based testing has emerged as a scalable and efficient alternative,yet existing surveys provide only partial coverage of recent methodological and technological advances.This review systematically analyzes 31 primary studies,and 10 surveys identified through a comprehensive search spanning 2015~2025;however,the in-depth methodological synthesis and comparative evaluation focus primarily on recent frameworks(2023~2025),reflecting the surge of Artificial Intelligent(AI)-assisted and multimodal approaches in this period.Traditional approaches rely on expert knowledge,ontologies,and naturalistic driving or accident data,while recent developments leverage generative models,including large language models,generative adversarial networks,diffusion models,and reinforcement learning frameworks,to synthesize diverse and safety-critical scenarios.Our synthesis identifies three persistent gaps:the absence of standardized evaluation metrics,limited integration of ethical and human factors,and insufficient coverage of multimodal and Operational Design Domain (ODD)-specific scenarios.To address these challenges,this review contributes a refined taxonomy that incorporates multimodal extensions,an ethical and safety checklist for responsible scenario design,and an ODD coverage map with a scenario-difficulty schema to enable transparent benchmarking.Collectively,these contributions provide methodological clarity for researchers and practical guidance for industry,supporting reproducible evaluation and accelerating the safe deployment of higher-level ADS.

TL;DR: 提出了Aletheia方法，通过剽窃检测算法分析JavaScript包来识别软件包版本，发现捆绑包更新速度快于CDN包，漏洞版本减少10倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有软件包版本检测机制无法全面分析现代Web应用的依赖更新行为，需要更好的方法来评估生产中软件包漏洞的真实普及情况

Method: 开发了Aletheia方法，使用剽窃检测算法分解JavaScript捆绑包来识别包版本，并爬取Tranco前10万域名进行大规模分析

Result: 方法在实践中明显优于现有方法；5%-20%的网站在16周内更新依赖；捆绑包更新速度显著快于CDN包

Conclusion: 捆绑包更新策略能显著减少已知漏洞，但少数大型供应商可能是及时更新的主要推动力，量化指标不能完全反映实际情况

Abstract: Reusable software components, typically distributed as packages, are a central paradigm of modern software development. The JavaScript ecosystem serves as a prime example, offering millions of packages with their use being promoted as idiomatic. However, download statistics on npm raise security concerns as they indicate a high popularity of vulnerable package versions while their real prevalence on production websites remains unknown. Package version detection mechanisms fill this gap by extracting utilized packages and versions from observed artifacts on the web. Prior research focuses on mechanisms for either hand-selected popular packages in bundles or for single-file resources utilizing the global namespace. This does not allow for a thorough analysis of modern web applications' dependency update behavior at scale. In this work, we improve upon this by presenting Aletheia, a package-agnostic method which dissects JavaScript bundles to identify package versions through algorithms originating from the field of plagiarism detection. We show that this method clearly outperforms the existing approaches in practical settings. Furthermore, we crawl the Tranco top 100,000 domains to reveal that 5% - 20% of domains update their dependencies within 16 weeks. Surprisingly, from a longitudinal perspective, bundled packages are updated significantly faster than their CDN-included counterparts, with consequently up to 10 times fewer known vulnerable package versions included. Still, we observe indicators that few widespread vendors seem to be a major driving force behind timely updates, implying that quantitative measures are not painting a complete picture.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于子模型的新型AAS架构，能够集成容器化服务实现动态交互和自适应功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有资产管理外壳(AAS)方法作为静态信息模型，缺乏对动态服务集成和系统自适应的支持。

Method: 通过在子模型中扩展行为定义，构建模块化事件驱动架构，支持基于触发条件部署容器化服务。

Result: 通过3轴铣床案例验证，使AAS不仅能作为被动数字表示，还能作为执行增值服务的主动接口。

Conclusion: 该方法为数字孪生环境中未来AI驱动的自适应和系统级智能奠定了基础。

Abstract: In manufacturing, digital twins, realized as Asset Administration Shells (AAS), have emerged as a prevalent practice. These digital replicas, often utilized as structured repositories of asset-related data, facilitate interoperability across diverse systems. However, extant approaches treat the AAS as a static information model, lacking support for dynamic service integration and system adaptation. The existing body of literature has not yet thoroughly explored the potential for integrating executable behavior, particularly in the form of containerized services, into or from the AAS. This integration could serve to enable proactive functionality. In this paper, we propose a submodel-based architecture that introduces a structured service notion to the AAS, enabling services to dynamically interact with and adapt AAS instances at runtime. This concept is implemented through the extension of a submodel with behavioral definitions, resulting in a modular event-driven architecture capable of deploying containerized services based on embedded trigger conditions. The approach is illustrated through a case study on a 3-axis milling machine. Our contribution enables the AAS to serve not only as a passive digital representation but also as an active interface for executing added-value services.%, thereby laying the foundation for future AI-driven adaptation and system-level intelligence in digital twin environments.

*Robert Heumüller,Frank Ortmeier*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于多主观排序的新型评估方法，用于评估ChatGPT在代码审查中的表现，发现ChatGPT生成的评论质量优于人类评论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码审查生成评估方法要么依赖于与单一标准答案的自动比较（无法捕捉人类观点的多样性），要么依赖于主观的“有用性”评估（概念模糊）。

Method: 使用CodeReview StackExchange上的280个自包含代码审查请求和相应评论数据集，让多个人类评审员对ChatGPT生成的评论与平台上的顶级人类回答进行质量排序。

Result: ChatGPT的评论排名显著优于人类评论，甚至超过了StackExchange上的已采纳答案。

Conclusion: 该方法为生成式AI在代码审查中的性能评估提供了更有意义的评估方式，同时提高了对未经检查集成到审查流程中潜在风险的认识。

Abstract: The use of large language models like ChatGPT in code review offers promising efficiency gains but also raises concerns about correctness and safety. Existing evaluation methods for code review generation either rely on automatic comparisons to a single ground truth, which fails to capture the variability of human perspectives, or on subjective assessments of "usefulness", a highly ambiguous concept. We propose a novel evaluation approach based on what we call multi-subjective ranking. Using a dataset of 280 self-contained code review requests and corresponding comments from CodeReview StackExchange, multiple human judges ranked the quality of ChatGPT-generated comments alongside the top human responses from the platform. Results show that ChatGPT's comments were ranked significantly better than human ones, even surpassing StackExchange's accepted answers. Going further, our proposed method motivates and enables more meaningful assessments of generative AI's performance in code review, while also raising awareness of potential risks of unchecked integration into review processes.

*Hua Yang,Alejandro Velasco,Thanh Le-Cong,Md Nazmul Haque,Bowen Xu,Denys Poshyvanyk*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文研究了语义等效代码转换技术如何削弱成员推断检测的有效性，发现变量重命名规则能显著降低检测成功率，暴露了代码大模型训练中许可证合规性执行的漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型代码语言模型的训练依赖于大量代码数据，包括公开的开源代码和私有代码，这引发了知识产权合规性和未经授权使用许可证受限代码的担忧。虽然已有成员推断技术来检测此类未经授权使用，但其有效性可能被语义等效代码转换技术削弱。

Method: 系统研究语义等效代码转换规则是否可用于规避成员推断检测，包括对单个转换规则和组合转换的效果分析，并进行因果分析验证。

Result: 每个转换规则在最坏情况下仅使模型准确率下降1.5%，表明转换后的数据集可有效替代微调。变量重命名规则使成员推断成功率降低10.19%，因果分析证实变量重命名对破坏成员推断检测具有最强的因果效应。组合多个转换不会进一步降低成员推断有效性。

Conclusion: 语义等效代码转换技术，特别是变量重命名，能显著削弱成员推断检测，暴露了代码大模型训练中许可证合规性执行的关键漏洞，表明基于转换的混淆技术可以大幅降低检测效果。

Abstract: The success of large language models for code relies on vast amounts of code data, including public open-source repositories, such as GitHub, and private, confidential code from companies. This raises concerns about intellectual property compliance and the potential unauthorized use of license-restricted code. While membership inference (MI) techniques have been proposed to detect such unauthorized usage, their effectiveness can be undermined by semantically equivalent code transformation techniques, which modify code syntax while preserving semantic.
  In this work, we systematically investigate whether semantically equivalent code transformation rules might be leveraged to evade MI detection. The results reveal that model accuracy drops by only 1.5% in the worst case for each rule, demonstrating that transformed datasets can effectively serve as substitutes for fine-tuning. Additionally, we find that one of the rules (RenameVariable) reduces MI success by 10.19%, highlighting its potential to obscure the presence of restricted code. To validate these findings, we conduct a causal analysis confirming that variable renaming has the strongest causal effect in disrupting MI detection. Notably, we find that combining multiple transformations does not further reduce MI effectiveness. Our results expose a critical loophole in license compliance enforcement for training large language models for code, showing that MI detection can be substantially weakened by transformation-based obfuscation techniques.

TL;DR: WuppieFuzz是基于LibAFL的开源REST API模糊测试工具，支持白盒、灰盒和黑盒测试，能自动生成测试序列并报告缺陷


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: REST API端点暴露带来安全风险，需要自动化测试技术来应对庞大的端点数量

Method: 使用OpenAPI规范生成初始输入语料库，通过REST特定和LibAFL提供的变异器探索代码路径，基于覆盖率指导测试序列选择

Result: 在Petstore API上评估了白盒方法的鲁棒性和不同功率调度策略的有效性，监测了端点和代码覆盖率

Conclusion: WuppieFuzz提供了有效的REST API自动化模糊测试解决方案，减少了手动测试工作量

Abstract: Many business processes currently depend on web services, often using REST APIs for communication. REST APIs expose web service functionality through endpoints, allowing easy client interaction over the Internet. To reduce the security risk resulting from exposed endpoints, thorough testing is desired. Due to the generally vast number of endpoints, automated testing techniques, like fuzzing, are of interest.
  This paper introduces WuppieFuzz, an open-source REST API fuzzer built on LibAFL, supporting white-box, grey-box and black-box fuzzing. Using an OpenAPI specification, it can generate an initial input corpus consisting of sequences of requests. These are mutated with REST-specific and LibAFL-provided mutators to explore different code paths in the software under test. Guided by the measured coverage, WuppieFuzz then selects which request sequences to send next to reach complex states in the software under test. In this process, it automates harness creation to reduce manual efforts often required in fuzzing. Different kinds of reporting are provided by the fuzzer to help fixing bugs.
  We evaluated our tool on the Petstore API to assess the robustness of the white-box approach and the effectiveness of different power schedules. We further monitored endpoint and code coverage over time to measure the efficacy of the approach.

TL;DR: 提出基于MLIR的Julia到SystemVerilog编译器工具链，解决FPGA专用加速器开发中的"双语言问题"


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着计算规模增长和专用加速器需求增加，当前FPGA开发存在算法描述与硬件实现语言分离的问题

Method: 开发MLIR编译器工具链，支持动态/静态调度，集成AXI4-Stream协议，生成厂商无关的RTL代码

Result: 在真实FPGA上实现100MHz运行，达到现有C/C++工具链59.71%-82.6%的吞吐量

Conclusion: 该工具链使领域专家可直接用Julia编写计算内核并无需修改即可部署到FPGA

Abstract: With the push towards Exascale computing and data-driven methods, problem sizes have increased dramatically, increasing the computational requirements of the underlying algorithms. This has led to a push to offload computations to general purpose hardware accelerators such as GPUs and TPUs, and a renewed interest in designing problem-specific accelerators using FPGAs. However, the development process of these problem-specific accelerators currently suffers from the "two-language problem": algorithms are developed in one (usually higher-level) language, but the kernels are implemented in another language at a completely different level of abstraction and requiring fundamentally different expertise. To address this problem, we propose a new MLIR-based compiler toolchain that unifies the development process by automatically compiling kernels written in the Julia programming language into SystemVerilog without the need for any additional directives or language customisations. Our toolchain supports both dynamic and static scheduling, directly integrates with the AXI4-Stream protocol to interface with subsystems like on- and off-chip memory, and generates vendor-agnostic RTL. This prototype toolchain is able to synthesize a set of signal processing/mathematical benchmarks that can operate at 100MHz on real FPGA devices, achieving between 59.71% and 82.6% of the throughput of designs generated by state-of-the-art toolchains that only compile from low-level languages like C or C++. Overall, this toolchain allows domain experts to write compute kernels in Julia as they normally would, and then retarget them to an FPGA without additional pragmas or modifications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解Transformer语言模型表现出的推理行为为何在符号操作任务上依然脆弱，为其提供统一的理论解释框架。

Method: 将自注意力机制和残差流解释为VSA操作：查询/键定义角色空间，值编码填充物，注意力权重实现软解绑，残差连接实现多重绑定结构的叠加。

Result: 建立了Transformer内部机制与思维链跟踪、程序推理和记忆增强工具使用之间的联系，解释了变量混淆和逻辑不一致等典型失效模式。

Conclusion: 将注意力视为软向量符号计算为构建更可解释和逻辑可靠的推理系统提供了有原则的路径。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models display impressive reasoning-like behavior, yet remain brittle on tasks that require stable symbolic manipulation. This paper develops a unified perspective on these phenomena by interpreting self-attention and residual streams as implementing an approximate Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA). In this view, queries and keys define role spaces, values encode fillers, attention weights perform soft unbinding, and residual connections realize superposition of many bound structures. We use this algebraic lens to relate transformer internals to chain-of-thought traces, program-based reasoning, and memory-augmented tool use, and to explain characteristic failure modes such as variable confusion and inconsistency across logically related prompts. Building on this perspective, we propose VSA-inspired architectural biases, including explicit binding/unbinding heads and hyperdimensional memory layers, and training objectives that promote role-filler separation and robust superposition. Finally, we outline metrics for measuring "VSA-likeness" and logical compositionality, and pose theoretical and architectural open problems. Overall, the paper argues that viewing attention as soft vector-symbolic computation offers a principled route toward more interpretable and logically reliable reasoning systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型在知识图谱问答上表现良好，但大部分评测基于完整图谱，忽视了现实世界中图谱不完整的情况，导致评估偏重浅层检索而忽略深层推理能力。

Method: 提出了一种构建不完整知识图谱评测基准的方法，移除直接支持的三元组但保留替代推理路径；并设计了自适应图推理智能体GR-Agent，通过构建交互环境、定义动作空间（图推理工具）和维护推理证据记忆来实现问答。

Result: 实验表明，现有方法在不完整图谱下性能显著下降；而GR-Agent在完整和不完整设置下均优于非训练基线，并与训练方法表现相当。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了现有方法在不完整图谱下的推理局限性，GR-Agent为解决这一问题提供了有效方案，增强了知识图谱问答的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong results on knowledge graph question answering (KGQA), but most benchmarks assume complete knowledge graphs (KGs) where direct supporting triples exist. This reduces evaluation to shallow retrieval and overlooks the reality of incomplete KGs, where many facts are missing and answers must be inferred from existing facts. We bridge this gap by proposing a methodology for constructing benchmarks under KG incompleteness, which removes direct supporting triples while ensuring that alternative reasoning paths required to infer the answer remain. Experiments on benchmarks constructed using our methodology show that existing methods suffer consistent performance degradation under incompleteness, highlighting their limited reasoning ability. To overcome this limitation, we present the Adaptive Graph Reasoning Agent (GR-Agent). It first constructs an interactive environment from the KG, and then formalizes KGQA as agent environment interaction within this environment. GR-Agent operates over an action space comprising graph reasoning tools and maintains a memory of potential supporting reasoning evidence, including relevant relations and reasoning paths. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GR-Agent outperforms non-training baselines and performs comparably to training-based methods under both complete and incomplete settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前大语言模型在生成正确且意图对齐的基础设施即代码方面成功率较低，特别是针对Terraform场景。

Method: 系统性地实施了多种知识注入技术，从朴素检索增强生成逐步发展到更复杂的图检索增强生成方法，包括图组件的语义增强和资源间依赖关系建模。

Result: 实验结果显示，基线LLM性能较差（总体成功率27.1%），注入结构化配置知识后，技术验证成功率提升至75.3%，总体成功率提升至62.6%。

Conclusion: 虽然技术正确性显著提升，但意图对齐达到平台期，揭示了'正确性-一致性鸿沟'：LLM可以成为熟练的'编码者'，但在满足细致用户意图方面仍是有限的'架构师'。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) currently exhibit low success rates in generating correct and intent-aligned Infrastructure as Code (IaC). This research investigated methods to improve LLM-based IaC generation, specifically for Terraform, by systematically injecting structured configuration knowledge. To facilitate this, an existing IaC-Eval benchmark was significantly enhanced with cloud emulation and automated error analysis. Additionally, a novel error taxonomy for LLM-assisted IaC code generation was developed. A series of knowledge injection techniques was implemented and evaluated, progressing from Naive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to more sophisticated Graph RAG approaches. These included semantic enrichment of graph components and modeling inter-resource dependencies. Experimental results demonstrated that while baseline LLM performance was poor (27.1% overall success), injecting structured configuration knowledge increased technical validation success to 75.3% and overall success to 62.6%. Despite these gains in technical correctness, intent alignment plateaued, revealing a "Correctness-Congruence Gap" where LLMs can become proficient "coders" but remain limited "architects" in fulfilling nuanced user intent.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the damage agricultural regions in rural areas face from climate-related risks by leveraging agentic AI for adaptive risk-management solutions and decision-making strategies, particularly for vulnerable rural communities.

Method: The method involves developing AgroAskAI, a multi-agent reasoning system with a modular, role-specialized architecture using a chain-of-responsibility approach to coordinate autonomous agents. It integrates real-time tools and datasets, includes governance mechanisms to mitigate hallucination, and supports multilingual interactions.

Result: Experimental results on common agricultural queries related to climate adaptation show that AgroAskAI, with additional tools and prompt refinement, delivers more actionable, grounded, and inclusive outputs.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that AgroAskAI demonstrates the potential of agentic AI for providing sustainable and accountable decision support in climate adaptation for agriculture.

Abstract: Agricultural regions in rural areas face damage from climate-related risks, including droughts, heavy rainfall, and shifting weather patterns. Prior research calls for adaptive risk-management solutions and decision-making strategies. To this end, artificial intelligence (AI), particularly agentic AI, offers a promising path forward. Agentic AI systems consist of autonomous, specialized agents capable of solving complex, dynamic tasks. While past systems have relied on single-agent models or have used multi-agent frameworks only for static functions, there is a growing need for architectures that support dynamic collaborative reasoning and context-aware outputs. To bridge this gap, we present AgroAskAI, a multi-agent reasoning system for climate adaptation decision support in agriculture, with a focus on vulnerable rural communities. AgroAskAI features a modular, role-specialized architecture that uses a chain-of-responsibility approach to coordinate autonomous agents, integrating real-time tools and datasets. The system has built-in governance mechanisms that mitigate hallucination and enable internal feedback for coherent, locally relevant strategies. The system also supports multilingual interactions, making it accessible to non-English-speaking farmers. Experiments on common agricultural queries related to climate adaptation show that, with additional tools and prompt refinement, AgroAskAI delivers more actionable, grounded, and inclusive outputs. Our experimental results highlight the potential of agentic AI for sustainable and accountable decision support in climate adaptation for agriculture.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的LLM评估依赖与基准系统的准确性对齐，但高标量准确率不一定反映稳健的概念理解能力

Method: 提出几何稳定性框架，通过不变变换（棋盘旋转、镜像对称、颜色反转等）测试模型一致性，并在6个前沿LLM上应用

Abstract: The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex reasoning domains typically relies on performance alignment with ground-truth oracles. In the domain of chess, this standard manifests as accuracy benchmarks against strong engines like Stockfish. However, high scalar accuracy does not necessarily imply robust conceptual understanding. This paper argues that standard accuracy metrics fail to distinguish between genuine geometric reasoning and the superficial memorization of canonical board states. To address this gap, we propose a Geometric Stability Framework, a novel evaluation methodology that rigorously tests model consistency under invariant transformations-including board rotation, mirror symmetry, color inversion, and format conversion. We applied this framework to a comparative analysis of six state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT-5.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and Kimi K2 Turbo, utilizing a dataset of approximately 3,000 positions. Our results reveal a significant Accuracy-Stability Paradox. While models such as GPT-5.1 achieve near-optimal accuracy on standard positions, they exhibit catastrophic degradation under geometric perturbation, specifically in rotation tasks where error rates surge by over 600%. This disparity suggests a reliance on pattern matching over abstract spatial logic. Conversely, Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Kimi K2 Turbo demonstrate superior dual robustness, maintaining high consistency across all transformation axes. Furthermore, we analyze the trade-off between helpfulness and safety, identifying Gemini 2.5 Flash as the leader in illegal state rejection (96.0%). We conclude that geometric stability provides an orthogonal and essential metric for AI evaluation, offering a necessary proxy for disentangling reasoning capabilities from data contamination and overfitting in large-scale models.

Conclusion: CogER框架通过动态选择推理策略，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了LLM的推理准确性，特别是在处理不同难度查询时表现出色。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various language tasks. However, existing LLM reasoning strategies mainly rely on the LLM itself with fast or slow mode (like o1 thinking) and thus struggle to balance reasoning efficiency and accuracy across queries of varying difficulties. In this paper, we propose Cognitive-Inspired Elastic Reasoning (CogER), a framework inspired by human hierarchical reasoning that dynamically selects the most suitable reasoning strategy for each query. Specifically, CogER first assesses the complexity of incoming queries and assigns them to one of several predefined levels, each corresponding to a tailored processing strategy, thereby addressing the challenge of unobservable query difficulty. To achieve automatic strategy selection, we model the process as a Markov Decision Process and train a CogER-Agent using reinforcement learning. The agent is guided by a reward function that balances solution quality and computational cost, ensuring resource-efficient reasoning. Moreover, for queries requiring external tools, we introduce Cognitive Tool-Assisted Reasoning, which enables the LLM to autonomously invoke external tools within its chain-of-thought. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CogER outperforms state-of-the-art Test-Time scaling methods, achieving at least a 13% relative improvement in average exact match on In-Domain tasks and an 8% relative gain on Out-of-Domain tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于聚类的变量排序框架，通过将变量分组为聚类来缩减动态变量排序的搜索空间，在最大加权独立集问题上显著降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散优化中的松弛决策图(DD)依赖于变量排序质量来获得紧致的对偶边界，但全局动态变量排序计算开销大，需要在边界紧致性和计算效率之间权衡。

Method: 提出聚类框架：先将变量分区为聚类，再进行排序。研究两种策略：1) Cluster-to-Cluster基于聚合准则顺序处理聚类；2) Pick-and-Sort迭代选择排序代表性变量。针对MWISP问题理论分析DD大小增长，提出两种聚类数量设置策略。

Result: 将该方法嵌入基于DD的分支定界算法，在MWISP基准测试中一致降低计算成本。

Conclusion: 基于聚类的变量排序框架有效平衡了边界质量和计算效率，为离散优化中的决策图编译提供了新的结构化方法。

Abstract: Efficient exact algorithms for Discrete Optimization (DO) rely heavily on strong primal and dual bounds. Relaxed Decision Diagrams (DDs) provide a versatile mechanism for deriving such dual bounds by compactly over-approximating the solution space through node merging. However, the quality of these relaxed diagrams, i.e. the tightness of the resulting dual bounds, depends critically on the variable ordering and the merging decisions executed during compilation. While dynamic variable ordering heuristics effectively tighten bounds, they often incur computational overhead when evaluated globally across the entire variable set. To mitigate this trade-off, this work introduces a novel clustering-based framework for variable ordering. Instead of applying dynamic ordering heuristics to the full set of unfixed variables, we first partition variables into clusters. We then leverage this structural decomposition to guide the ordering process, significantly reducing the heuristic's search space. Within this framework, we investigate two distinct strategies: Cluster-to-Cluster, which processes clusters sequentially using problem-specific aggregate criteria (such as cumulative vertex weights in the Maximum Weighted Independent Set Problem (MWISP)), and Pick-and-Sort, which iteratively selects and sorts representative variables from each cluster to balance local diversity with heuristic guidance. Later on, developing some theoretical results on the growth of the size of DDs for MWISP we propose two different policies for setting the number of clusters within the proposed framework. We embed these strategies into a DD-based branch-and-bound algorithm and evaluate them on the MWISP. Across benchmark instances, the proposed methodology consistently reduces computational costs compared to standard dynamic variable ordering baseline.

Abstract: The rapid development of Generative AI is bringing innovative changes to education and assessment. As the prevalence of students utilizing AI for assignments increases, concerns regarding academic integrity and the validity of assessments are growing. This study utilizes the Earth Science I section of the 2025 Korean College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT) to deeply analyze the multimodal scientific reasoning capabilities and cognitive limitations of state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. Three experimental conditions (full-page input, individual item input, and optimized multimodal input) were designed to evaluate model performance across different data structures. Quantitative results indicated that unstructured inputs led to significant performance degradation due to segmentation and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) failures. Even under optimized conditions, models exhibited fundamental reasoning flaws. Qualitative analysis revealed that "Perception Errors" were dominant, highlighting a "Perception-Cognition Gap" where models failed to interpret symbolic meanings in schematic diagrams despite recognizing visual data. Furthermore, models demonstrated a "Calculation-Conceptualization Discrepancy," successfully performing calculations while failing to apply the underlying scientific concepts, and "Process Hallucination," where models skipped visual verification in favor of plausible but unfounded background knowledge. Addressing the challenge of unauthorized AI use in coursework, this study provides actionable cues for designing "AI-resistant questions" that target these specific cognitive vulnerabilities. By exploiting AI's weaknesses, such as the gap between perception and cognition, educators can distinguish genuine student competency from AI-generated responses, thereby ensuring assessment fairness.

Method: 提出SCOPE框架，通过双流机制平衡战术特异性与战略通用性，结合视角驱动探索优化策略覆盖

Result: 在HLE基准测试中，任务成功率显著提升

Conclusion: SCOPE为LLM智能体的上下文管理提供了有效的自动化解决方案

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed in environments that generate massive, dynamic contexts. However, a critical bottleneck remains: while agents have access to this context, their static prompts lack the mechanisms to manage it effectively, leading to recurring Corrective and Enhancement failures. To address this capability gap, we introduce \textbf{SCOPE} (Self-evolving Context Optimization via Prompt Evolution). SCOPE frames context management as an \textit{online optimization} problem, synthesizing guidelines from execution traces to automatically evolve the agent's prompt. We propose a Dual-Stream mechanism that balances tactical specificity (resolving immediate errors) with strategic generality (evolving long-term principles). Furthermore, we introduce Perspective-Driven Exploration to maximize strategy coverage, increasing the likelihood that the agent has the correct strategy for any given task. Experiments on the HLE benchmark show that SCOPE improves task success rates from 14.23\% to 38.64\% without human intervention. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/JarvisPei/SCOPE.

Abstract: In multi-player card games such as Skat or Bridge, the early stages of the game, such as bidding, game selection, and initial card selection, are often more critical to the success of the play than refined middle- and end-game play. At the current limits of computation, such early decision-making resorts to using statistical information derived from a large corpus of human expert games. In this paper, we derive and evaluate a general bootstrapping outer-learning framework that improves prediction accuracy by expanding the database of human games with millions of self-playing AI games to generate and merge statistics. We implement perfect feature hash functions to address compacted tables, producing a self-improving card game engine, where newly inferred knowledge is continuously improved during self-learning. The case study in Skat shows that the automated approach can be used to support various decisions in the game.

Abstract: Due to the restricted resources, efficient scheduling in vertiports has received much more attention in the field of Urban Air Mobility (UAM). For the scheduling problem, we utilize a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP), which is often formulated in a resource-restricted project scheduling problem (RCPSP). In this paper, we show our approach to handle both dynamic operation requirements and vague rescheduling requests from humans. Particularly, we utilize a three-valued logic for interpreting ambiguous user intents and a decision tree, proposing a newly integrated system that combines Answer Set Programming (ASP) and MILP. This integrated framework optimizes schedules and supports human inputs transparently. With this system, we provide a robust structure for explainable, adaptive UAM scheduling.

Conclusion: SDE框架为LLMs的发现相关评估提供了可复现基准，并为推进其科学发现能力的发展指明了实践路径

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to scientific research, yet prevailing science benchmarks probe decontextualized knowledge and overlook the iterative reasoning, hypothesis generation, and observation interpretation that drive scientific discovery. We introduce a scenario-grounded benchmark that evaluates LLMs across biology, chemistry, materials, and physics, where domain experts define research projects of genuine interest and decompose them into modular research scenarios from which vetted questions are sampled. The framework assesses models at two levels: (i) question-level accuracy on scenario-tied items and (ii) project-level performance, where models must propose testable hypotheses, design simulations or experiments, and interpret results. Applying this two-phase scientific discovery evaluation (SDE) framework to state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a consistent performance gap relative to general science benchmarks, diminishing return of scaling up model sizes and reasoning, and systematic weaknesses shared across top-tier models from different providers. Large performance variation in research scenarios leads to changing choices of the best performing model on scientific discovery projects evaluated, suggesting all current LLMs are distant to general scientific "superintelligence". Nevertheless, LLMs already demonstrate promise in a great variety of scientific discovery projects, including cases where constituent scenario scores are low, highlighting the role of guided exploration and serendipity in discovery. This SDE framework offers a reproducible benchmark for discovery-relevant evaluation of LLMs and charts practical paths to advance their development toward scientific discovery.

Abstract: When should we delegate decisions to AI systems? While the value alignment literature has developed techniques for shaping AI values, less attention has been paid to how to determine, under uncertainty, when imperfect alignment is good enough to justify delegation. We argue that rational delegation requires balancing an agent's value (mis)alignment with its epistemic accuracy and its reach (the acts it has available). This paper introduces a formal, decision-theoretic framework to analyze this tradeoff precisely accounting for a principal's uncertainty about these factors. Our analysis reveals a sharp distinction between two delegation scenarios. First, universal delegation (trusting an agent with any problem) demands near-perfect value alignment and total epistemic trust, conditions rarely met in practice. Second, we show that context-specific delegation can be optimal even with significant misalignment. An agent's superior accuracy or expanded reach may grant access to better overall decision problems, making delegation rational in expectation. We develop a novel scoring framework to quantify this ex ante decision. Ultimately, our work provides a principled method for determining when an AI is aligned enough for a given context, shifting the focus from achieving perfect alignment to managing the risks and rewards of delegation under uncertainty.

Conclusion: STC代表向具有内置批判性思维的大型语言模型迈出的一步，通过统一框架有效整合推理和验证。

Abstract: Human beings solve complex problems through critical thinking, where reasoning and evaluation are intertwined to converge toward correct solutions. However, most existing large language models (LLMs) decouple reasoning from verification: they either generate reasoning without explicit self-checking or rely on external verifiers to detect errors post hoc. The former lacks immediate feedback, while the latter increases system complexity and hinders synchronized learning. Motivated by human critical thinking, we propose Stepwise Think-Critique (STC), a unified framework that interleaves reasoning and self-critique at each step within a single model. STC is trained with a hybrid reinforcement learning objective combining reasoning rewards and critique-consistency rewards to jointly optimize reasoning quality and self-evaluation. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that STC demonstrates strong critic-thinking capabilities and produces more interpretable reasoning traces, representing a step toward LLMs with built-in critical thinking.

Conclusion: CAGE框架通过构建属性图，将代际影响纳入考量，显著提升了上下文归因的忠实度，在多个模型、数据集和指标上平均提升了40%。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities, yet their reasoning remains opaque, raising safety and trust concerns. Attribution methods, which assign credit to input features, have proven effective for explaining the decision making of computer vision models. From these, context attributions have emerged as a promising approach for explaining the behavior of autoregressive LLMs. However, current context attributions produce incomplete explanations by directly relating generated tokens to the prompt, discarding inter-generational influence in the process. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce the Context Attribution via Graph Explanations (CAGE) framework. CAGE introduces an attribution graph: a directed graph that quantifies how each generation is influenced by both the prompt and all prior generations. The graph is constructed to preserve two properties-causality and row stochasticity. The attribution graph allows context attributions to be computed by marginalizing intermediate contributions along paths in the graph. Across multiple models, datasets, metrics, and methods, CAGE improves context attribution faithfulness, achieving average gains of up to 40%.

Abstract: Existing agent communication frameworks face critical limitations in providing verifiable audit trails without compromising the privacy and confidentiality of agent interactions. The protection of agent communication privacy while ensuring auditability emerges as a fundamental challenge for applications requiring accurate billing, compliance verification, and accountability in regulated environments.
  We introduce a framework for auditing agent communications that keeps messages private while still checking they follow expected rules. It pairs zero-knowledge proofs with the existing Model Context Protocol (MCP) so messages can be verified without revealing their contents. The approach runs in lightweight networks, stays compatible with standard MCP exchanges, and adds asynchronous audit verification to confirm format and general message types without exposing specifics.
  The framework enables mutual audits between agents: one side can check communication content and quality while the other verifies usage metrics, all without revealing sensitive information. We formalize security goals and show that zk-MCP provides data authenticity and communication privacy, achieving efficient verification with negligible latency overhead. We fully implement the framework, including Circom-based zero-knowledge proof generation and an audit protocol integrated with MCP's bidirectional channel, and, to our knowledge, this is the first privacy-preserving audit system for agent communications that offers verifiable mutual auditing without exposing message content or compromising agent privacy.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks embed malicious behaviors into Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling adversaries to trigger harmful outputs or bypass safety controls. However, the persistence of the implanted backdoors under user-driven post-deployment continual fine-tuning has been rarely examined. Most prior works evaluate the effectiveness and generalization of implanted backdoors only at releasing and empirical evidence shows that naively injected backdoor persistence degrades after updates. In this work, we study whether and how implanted backdoors persist through a multi-stage post-deployment fine-tuning. We propose P-Trojan, a trigger-based attack algorithm that explicitly optimizes for backdoor persistence across repeated updates. By aligning poisoned gradients with those of clean tasks on token embeddings, the implanted backdoor mapping is less likely to be suppressed or forgotten during subsequent updates. Theoretical analysis shows the feasibility of such persistent backdoor attacks after continual fine-tuning. And experiments conducted on the Qwen2.5 and LLaMA3 families of LLMs, as well as diverse task sequences, demonstrate that P-Trojan achieves over 99% persistence while preserving clean-task accuracy. Our findings highlight the need for persistence-aware evaluation and stronger defenses in realistic model adaptation pipelines.

Abstract: Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) enhance modularity and telemetry granularity but also widen the cybersecurity attack surface across disaggregated control, user and management planes. We propose a hierarchical defense framework with three coordinated layers-anomaly detection, intrusion confirmation, and multiattack classification-each aligned with O-RAN's telemetry stack. Our approach integrates hybrid quantum computing and machine learning, leveraging amplitude- and entanglement-based feature encodings with deep and ensemble classifiers. We conduct extensive benchmarking across synthetic and real-world telemetry, evaluating encoding depth, architectural variants, and diagnostic fidelity. The framework consistently achieves near-perfect accuracy, high recall, and strong class separability. Multi-faceted evaluation across decision boundaries, probabilistic margins, and latent space geometry confirms its interpretability, robustness, and readiness for slice-aware diagnostics and scalable deployment in near-RT and non-RT RIC domains.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了Factor(U,T)协议，使用不可信模型进行任务分解，可信模型执行子任务。研究发现仅监控任务分解难以检测恶意行为，而监控具体实施方案效果更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI能力提升，我们依赖强大模型分解复杂任务，但若分解器本身是恶意的呢？现有工作使用可信模型进行分解，限制了在分解本身具有挑战性任务中的实用性。

Method: 引入Factor(U,T)协议，使用不可信模型进行任务分解，可信模型执行子任务。在BigCodeBench数据集上进行的控制评估中，对比了仅监控任务分解和监控完整解决方案的效果。

Result: 仅监控任务分解的检测效果差(AUROC 0.52)，而监控完整Python解决方案的检测效果好(AUROC 0.96)。Factor(D,U)使用可信分解器并监控具体实施方案，取得了优秀判别效果(AUROC 0.96)和强安全性(1.2% ASR)。

Conclusion: 仅监控任务分解难以有效检测恶意行为，而监控具体实施方案能显著提高检测效果和安全性，证明在分解监控失败的场景下实施方案监控是成功的。

Abstract: As AI capabilities advance, we increasingly rely on powerful models to decompose complex tasks $\unicode{x2013}$ but what if the decomposer itself is malicious? Factored cognition protocols decompose complex tasks into simpler child tasks: one model creates the decomposition, while other models implement the child tasks in isolation. Prior work uses trusted (weaker but reliable) models for decomposition, which limits usefulness for tasks where decomposition itself is challenging. We introduce Factor($U$,$T$), in which an untrusted (stronger but potentially malicious) model decomposes while trusted models implement child tasks. Can monitors detect malicious activity when observing only natural language task instructions, rather than complete solutions? We baseline and red team Factor($U$,$T$) in control evaluations on BigCodeBench, a dataset of Python coding tasks. Monitors distinguishing malicious from honest decompositions perform poorly (AUROC 0.52) compared to monitors evaluating complete Python solutions (AUROC 0.96). Furthermore, Factor($D$,$U$), which uses a trusted decomposer and monitors concrete child solutions, achieves excellent discrimination (AUROC 0.96) and strong safety (1.2% ASR), demonstrating that implementation-context monitoring succeeds where decomposition-only monitoring fails.

TL;DR: BlindSpot是一个在设备上的系统，允许旁观者通过手势、可见光通信和超宽带通信三种方式实时表达隐私偏好，无需事先共享敏感信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 配备摄像头的移动设备对旁观者的隐私构成挑战，目前缺乏有效的实时机制来控制个人图像和面部的捕捉。

Method: 设计了三种不同的信号传输方式：手势机制、改进的可见光通信协议和新型超宽带通信协议，并采用几何一致性检查来验证信号来源。

Result: 在商用智能手机上实现了完整系统，对各种距离、光照条件和用户移动情况下的准确性和延迟进行了全面评估。

Conclusion: 研究证明了这些新型旁观者信号传输技术的可行性，以及在系统性能和便利性方面的权衡。

Abstract: Camera-equipped mobile devices, such as phones, smart glasses, and AR headsets, pose a privacy challenge for bystanders, who currently lack effective real-time mechanisms to control the capture of their picture, video, including their face. We present BlindSpot, an on-device system that enables bystanders to manage their own privacy by signaling their privacy preferences in real-time without previously sharing any sensitive information. Our main contribution is the design and comparative evaluation of three distinct signaling modalities: a hand gesture mechanism, a significantly improved visible light communication (VLC) protocol, and a novel ultra-wideband (UWB) communication protocol. For all these modalities, we also design a validation mechanism that uses geometric consistency checks to verify the origin of a signal relative to the sending bystander, and defend against impersonation attacks. We implement the complete system (BlindSpot) on a commodity smartphone and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of each modality's accuracy and latency across various distances, lighting conditions, and user movements. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of these novel bystander signaling techniques and their trade-offs in terms of system performance and convenience.

### [46] [One Leak Away: How Pretrained Model Exposure Amplifies Jailbreak Risks in Finetuned LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14751)
*Yixin Tan,Zhe Yu,Jun Sakuma*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Finetuned LLMs inherit jailbreak vulnerabilities from pretrained models; adversarial prompts transfer effectively, and a new PGP attack exploits this by targeting transferability-relevant directions in representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the security implications of finetuning pretrained LLMs, specifically whether finetuned models inherit jailbreak vulnerabilities from their pretrained sources, given the standard practice of finetuning for downstream applications.

Method: The research employs empirical analysis with a realistic threat model (white-box access to pretrained LLM, black-box to finetuned variants), representation-level probing to identify linearly separable transferable prompts, and develops the Probe-Guided Projection (PGP) attack to steer optimization toward transferability-relevant directions.

Result: Adversarial prompts optimized on pretrained models transfer effectively to finetuned variants, revealing inherited vulnerabilities. Representation-level probing shows transferable prompts are linearly separable in pretrained hidden states, and the PGP attack achieves strong transfer success across diverse LLM families and finetuned tasks.

Conclusion: The study reveals that finetuned LLMs inherit jailbreak vulnerabilities from their pretrained sources, and the proposed PGP attack demonstrates strong transfer success across multiple LLM families and tasks, highlighting significant security risks in the pretrain-to-finetune paradigm.

Abstract: Finetuning pretrained large language models (LLMs) has become the standard paradigm for developing downstream applications. However, its security implications remain unclear, particularly regarding whether finetuned LLMs inherit jailbreak vulnerabilities from their pretrained sources. We investigate this question in a realistic pretrain-to-finetune threat model, where the attacker has white-box access to the pretrained LLM and only black-box access to its finetuned derivatives. Empirical analysis shows that adversarial prompts optimized on the pretrained model transfer most effectively to its finetuned variants, revealing inherited vulnerabilities from pretrained to finetuned LLMs. To further examine this inheritance, we conduct representation-level probing, which shows that transferable prompts are linearly separable within the pretrained hidden states, suggesting that universal transferability is encoded in pretrained representations. Building on this insight, we propose the Probe-Guided Projection (PGP) attack, which steers optimization toward transferability-relevant directions. Experiments across multiple LLM families and diverse finetuned tasks confirm PGP's strong transfer success, underscoring the security risks inherent in the pretrain-to-finetune paradigm.

TL;DR: 针对大语言模型生成的代码水印方法的研究，提出了一种能抵抗注释移除攻击的新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码水印方法无法抵御注释移除攻击，且代码本身具有低熵特性，使得水印嵌入困难。

Method: 首先通过Cue List区分代码中的低熵和高熵部分，然后基于Cue List指导水印嵌入过程。

Result: 在HumanEval数据集上的实验表明，该方法在可检测性和可用性上都优于现有三种最先进的代码水印技术。

Conclusion: 提出的基于代码区域熵值特征的水印方法能有效抵抗注释移除攻击，同时保持较高的可用性。

Abstract: Watermarking large language models (LLMs) is vital for preventing their misuse, including the fabrication of fake news, plagiarism, and spam. It is especially important to watermark LLM-generated code, as it often contains intellectual property.However, we found that existing methods for watermarking LLM-generated code fail to address comment removal attack.In such cases, an attacker can simply remove the comments from the generated code without affecting its functionality, significantly reducing the effectiveness of current code-watermarking techniques.On the other hand, injecting a watermark into code is challenging because, as previous works have noted, most code represents a low-entropy scenario compared to natural language. Our approach to addressing this issue involves leveraging prior knowledge to distinguish between low-entropy and high-entropy parts of the code, as indicated by a Cue List of words.We then inject the watermark guided by this Cue List, achieving higher detectability and usability than existing methods.We evaluated our proposed method on HumanEvaland compared our method with three state-of-the-art code watermarking techniques. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决垂直联邦学习中在模型训练前评估各方特征贡献的挑战，特别是Shapley-CMI方法缺乏实际安全实现的问题。

Method: 提出了一个隐私保护的Shapley-CMI实现方案，引入私有集合交集（PSI）服务器来执行特征排列并计算加密交集大小，各方使用交集结果计算Shapley-CMI值。

Result: 初步实验证实了所提出系统的正确性和隐私保护能力，证明了其在VFL中安全高效评估特征贡献的可行性。

Conclusion: 该方法确保了数据机密性，可在多方之间扩展，并能在无需共享原始数据或训练模型的情况下实现公平的数据价值评估。初步实验验证了系统的正确性和隐私保护能力。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging machine learning paradigm that enables multiple parties to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data, ensuring data privacy. In Vertical FL (VFL), where each party holds different features for the same users, a key challenge is to evaluate the feature contribution of each party before any model is trained, particularly in the early stages when no model exists. To address this, the Shapley-CMI method was recently proposed as a model-free, information-theoretic approach to feature valuation using Conditional Mutual Information (CMI). However, its original formulation did not provide a practical implementation capable of computing the required permutations and intersections securely. This paper presents a novel privacy-preserving implementation of Shapley-CMI for VFL. Our system introduces a private set intersection (PSI) server that performs all necessary feature permutations and computes encrypted intersection sizes across discretized and encrypted ID groups, without the need for raw data exchange. Each party then uses these intersection results to compute Shapley-CMI values, computing the marginal utility of their features. Initial experiments confirm the correctness and privacy of the proposed system, demonstrating its viability for secure and efficient feature contribution estimation in VFL. This approach ensures data confidentiality, scales across multiple parties, and enables fair data valuation without requiring the sharing of raw data or training models.

TL;DR: 首次系统性渗透测试显示智能体AI系统存在严重安全风险，超过半数恶意攻击成功绕过企业级防护，不同框架和模型表现差异显著


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能体AI引入了传统LLM安全防护无法解决的安全漏洞，目前缺乏对不同模型和框架的对比分析

Method: 在AutoGen和CrewAI两个智能体AI框架上测试了五种主流模型（Claude 3.5 Sonnet、Gemini 2.5 Flash、GPT-4o、Grok 2和Nova Pro），采用七智能体架构模拟大学信息管理系统，设计了13种攻击场景（包括提示注入、SSRF、SQL注入和工具滥用），共130个测试用例

Result: AutoGen拒绝率为52.3%，CrewAI为30.8%；模型表现从Nova Pro的46.2%到Claude和Grok 2的38.5%不等；Grok 2在CrewAI上仅拒绝2/13次攻击（15.4%拒绝率）；总体拒绝率为41.5%，表明超过一半的恶意提示成功绕过安全机制

Conclusion: 研究揭示了智能体AI系统存在严重的安全漏洞，企业级安全机制在超过一半的恶意提示下失效。研究发现了六种不同的防御行为模式，包括一种新颖的

Abstract: Agentic AI introduces security vulnerabilities that traditional LLM safeguards fail to address. Although recent work by Unit 42 at Palo Alto Networks demonstrated that ChatGPT-4o successfully executes attacks as an agent that it refuses in chat mode, there is no comparative analysis in multiple models and frameworks. We conducted the first systematic penetration testing and comparative evaluation of agentic AI systems, testing five prominent models (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash, GPT-4o, Grok 2, and Nova Pro) across two agentic AI frameworks (AutoGen and CrewAI) using a seven-agent architecture that mimics the functionality of a university information management system and 13 distinct attack scenarios that span prompt injection, Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF), SQL injection, and tool misuse. Our 130 total test cases reveal significant security disparities: AutoGen demonstrates a 52.3% refusal rate versus CrewAI's 30.8%, while model performance ranges from Nova Pro's 46.2% to Claude and Grok 2's 38.5%. Most critically, Grok 2 on CrewAI rejected only 2 of 13 attacks (15.4% refusal rate), and the overall refusal rate of 41.5% across all configurations indicates that more than half of malicious prompts succeeded despite enterprise-grade safety mechanisms. We identify six distinct defensive behavior patterns including a novel "hallucinated compliance" strategy where models fabricate outputs rather than executing or refusing attacks, and provide actionable recommendations for secure agent deployment. Complete attack prompts are also included in the Appendix to enable reproducibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cloud Security Operations Center (SOC) enable cloud governance, risk and compliance by providing insights visibility and control. Cloud SOC triages high-volume, heterogeneous telemetry from elastic, short-lived resources while staying within tight budgets.

Method: The architecture uses three Amazon EC2 instances: Attacker, Defender, and Monitoring. We simulate a reverse-shell intrusion with Metasploit, and Filebeat forwards Defender logs to an Elasticsearch and Kibana stack for analysis. We train two classifiers, a malware detector built on a public dataset and a log-anomaly detector trained on synthetically augmented logs that include adversarial variants. We calibrate and fuse the scores to produce multi-modal threat intelligence.

Result: On held-out tests the fusion achieves strong macro-F1 (up to 1.00) under controlled conditions, though performance will vary in noisier and more diverse environments.

Conclusion: These results indicate that simple, calibrated fusion can enhance cloud SOC capabilities in constrained, cost-sensitive setups.

Abstract: Reverse engineering of gate-level netlist is critical for Hardware Trojans detection and Design Piracy counteracting. The primary task of gate-level reverse engineering is to separate the control and data signals from the netlist, which is mainly realized by identifying state registers with topological comparison.However, these methods become inefficient for large scale netlist. In this work, we propose RELIC-GNN, a graph neural network based state registers identification method, to address these issues. RELIC-GNN models the path structure of register as a graph and generates corresponding representation by considering node attributes and graph structure during training. The trained GNN model could be adopted to find the registers type very efficiently. Experimental results show that RELIC-GNN could achieve 100% in recall, 30.49% in precision and 88.37% in accuracy on average across different designs, which obtains significant improvements than previous approaches.

### [53] [Quantifying Return on Security Controls in LLM Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15081)
*Richard Helder Moulton,Austin O'Brien,John D. Hastings*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework to quantify LLM security risks and compare defenses. Testing a RAG system with synthetic PII, it finds ABAC and NER redaction significantly reduce losses, while NeMo Guardrails provides minimal protection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in security-critical workflows, but practitioners lack quantitative guidance on which safeguards are worth deploying. The paper aims to provide a framework to quantify residual risk and enable monetary comparison of layered defenses.

Method: The paper uses a RAG service with DeepSeek-R1 model on synthetic PII data, subjected to automated attacks (Garak) across five vulnerability classes. It employs Laplace's Rule of Succession to estimate attack success probabilities and 10,000-run Monte Carlo simulations with loss triangle distributions calibrated from public breach-cost data to produce loss exceedance curves and expected losses.

Result: The baseline RAG system showed very high attack success rates (>=0.98 for PII, latent injection, and prompt injection), with a total simulated expected loss of $313k per attack scenario. ABAC reduced success probabilities for PII and prompt-related attacks to near zero, cutting expected loss by ~94% (RoC=9.83). NER redaction eliminated PII leakage (RoC=5.97), while NeMo Guardrails offered marginal benefit (RoC=0.05).

Conclusion: The study concludes that ABAC is the most effective mitigation, reducing expected losses by 94% with a high RoC of 9.83, while NER redaction also performs well with an RoC of 5.97. NeMo Guardrails provides minimal benefit.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in security-critical workflows, practitioners lack quantitative guidance on which safeguards are worth deploying. This paper introduces a decision-oriented framework and reproducible methodology that together quantify residual risk, convert adversarial probe outcomes into financial risk estimates and return-on-control (RoC) metrics, and enable monetary comparison of layered defenses for LLM-based systems. A retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) service is instantiated using the DeepSeek-R1 model over a corpus containing synthetic personally identifiable information (PII), and subjected to automated attacks with Garak across five vulnerability classes: PII leakage, latent context injection, prompt injection, adversarial attack generation, and divergence. For each (vulnerability, control) pair, attack success probabilities are estimated via Laplace's Rule of Succession and combined with loss triangle distributions, calibrated from public breach-cost data, in 10,000-run Monte Carlo simulations to produce loss exceedance curves and expected losses. Three widely used mitigations, attribute-based access control (ABAC); named entity recognition (NER) redaction using Microsoft Presidio; and NeMo Guardrails, are then compared to a baseline RAG configuration. The baseline system exhibits very high attack success rates (>= 0.98 for PII, latent injection, and prompt injection), yielding a total simulated expected loss of $313k per attack scenario. ABAC collapses success probabilities for PII and prompt-related attacks to near zero and reduces the total expected loss by ~94%, achieving an RoC of 9.83. NER redaction likewise eliminates PII leakage and attains an RoC of 5.97, while NeMo Guardrails provides only marginal benefit (RoC of 0.05).

Abstract: As the Ethereum platform continues to mature and gain widespread usage, it is crucial to maintain high standards of smart contract writing practices. While bad practices in smart contracts may not directly lead to security issues, they elevate the risk of encountering problems. Therefore, to understand and avoid these bad practices, this paper introduces the first systematic study of bad practices in smart contracts, delving into over 47 specific issues. Specifically, we propose SCALM, an LLM-powered framework featuring two methodological innovations: (1) A hybrid architecture that combines context-aware function-level slicing with knowledge-enhanced semantic reasoning via extensible vectorized pattern matching. (2) A multi-layer reasoning verification system connects low-level code patterns with high-level security principles through syntax, design patterns, and architecture analysis. Our extensive experiments using multiple LLMs and datasets have shown that SCALM outperforms existing tools in detecting bad practices in smart contracts.

Conclusion: 寄生射频敏感性为物理隔离系统提供了未被探索的命令与控制通道，挑战了其固有隔离性的假设。

Abstract: Intelligent electronics are deeply embedded in critical infrastructures and must remain reliable, particularly against deliberate attacks. To minimize risks and impede remote compromise, sensitive systems can be physically isolated from external networks, forming an airgap. Yet, airgaps can still be infiltrated by capable adversaries gaining code execution. Prior research has shown that attackers can then attempt to wirelessly exfiltrate data across the airgap by exploiting unintended radio emissions. In this work, we demonstrate reversal of this link: malicious code execution on embedded devices can enable wireless infiltration of airgapped systems without any hardware modification. In contrast to previous infiltration methods that depend on dedicated sensors (e.g., microphones, LEDs, or temperature sensors) or require strict line-of-sight, we show that unmodified, sensor-less embedded devices can inadvertently act as radio receivers. This phenomenon stems from parasitic RF sensitivity in PCB traces and on-chip analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), allowing external transmissions to be received and decoded entirely in software.
  Across twelve commercially available embedded devices and two custom prototypes, we observe repeatable reception in the 300-1000 MHz range, with detectable signal power as low as 1 mW. To this end, we propose a systematic methodology to identify device configurations that foster such radio sensitivities and comprehensively evaluate their feasibility for wireless data reception. Exploiting these sensitivities, we demonstrate successful data reception over tens of meters, even in non-line-of-sight conditions and show that the reception sensitivities accommodate data rates of up to 100 kbps. Our findings reveal a previously unexplored command-and-control vector for air-gapped systems while challenging assumptions about their inherent isolation. [shortened]

This study evaluates both classical feature-based methods and deep learning approaches that transform binary executables into visual representations, specifically, grayscale byte plots, and employ convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for automated classification of packed and non-packed binaries. A diverse dataset of benign and malicious Portable Executable (PE) files, packed using various commercial and open-source packers, was curated to capture a broad spectrum of packing transformations and obfuscation techniques. Classical models using handcrafted Gabor jet features achieved intense discrimination at moderate computational cost. In contrast, CNNs based on VGG16 and DenseNet121 significantly outperformed them, achieving high detection performance with well-balanced precision, recall, and F1-scores. DenseNet121 demonstrated slightly higher precision and lower false positive rates, whereas VGG16 achieved marginally higher recall, indicating complementary strengths for practical deployment. Evaluation against unknown packers confirmed robust generalization, demonstrating that grayscale byte-plot representations combined with deep learning provide a useful and reliable approach for early detection of packed malware, enhancing malware analysis pipelines and supporting automated antivirus inspection.

Abstract: Vehicular platooning promises transformative improvements in transportation efficiency and safety through the coordination of multi-vehicle formations enabled by Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication. However, the distributed nature of platoon coordination creates security vulnerabilities, allowing authenticated vehicles to inject falsified kinematic data, compromise operational stability, and pose a threat to passenger safety. Traditional misbehaviour detection approaches, which rely on plausibility checks and statistical methods, suffer from high False Positive (FP) rates and cannot capture the complex temporal dependencies inherent in multi-vehicle coordination dynamics. We present Attention In Motion (AIMformer), a transformer-based framework specifically tailored for real-time misbehaviour detection in vehicular platoons with edge deployment capabilities. AIMformer leverages multi-head self-attention mechanisms to simultaneously capture intra-vehicle temporal dynamics and inter-vehicle spatial correlations. It incorporates global positional encoding with vehicle-specific temporal offsets to handle join/exit maneuvers. We propose a Precision-Focused (BCE) loss function that penalizes FPs to meet the requirements of safety-critical vehicular systems. Extensive evaluation across 4 platoon controllers, multiple attack vectors, and diverse mobility scenarios demonstrates superior performance ($\geq$ 0.93) compared to state-of-the-art baseline architectures. A comprehensive deployment analysis utilizing TensorFlow Lite (TFLite), Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX), and TensorRT achieves sub-millisecond inference latency, making it suitable for real-time operation on resource-constrained edge platforms. Hence, validating AIMformer is viable for both in-vehicle and roadside infrastructure deployment.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of deep learning has turned models into highly valuable assets due to their reliance on massive data and costly training processes. However, these models are increasingly vulnerable to leakage and theft, highlighting the critical need for robust intellectual property protection. Model watermarking has emerged as an effective solution, with black-box watermarking gaining significant attention for its practicality and flexibility. Nonetheless, existing black-box methods often fail to better balance covertness (hiding the watermark to prevent detection and forgery) and robustness (ensuring the watermark resists removal)-two essential properties for real-world copyright verification. In this paper, we propose ComMark, a novel black-box model watermarking framework that leverages frequency-domain transformations to generate compressed, covert, and attack-resistant watermark samples by filtering out high-frequency information. To further enhance watermark robustness, our method incorporates simulated attack scenarios and a similarity loss during training. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse datasets and architectures demonstrate that ComMark achieves state-of-the-art performance in both covertness and robustness. Furthermore, we extend its applicability beyond image recognition to tasks including speech recognition, sentiment analysis, image generation, image captioning, and video recognition, underscoring its versatility and broad applicability.

Abstract: We present the Distributed High-Dimensional Matrix Mechanism (Distributed HDMM), a protocol for answering workloads of linear queries on distributed data that provides the accuracy of central-model HDMM without a trusted curator. Distributed HDMM leverages a secure aggregation protocol to evaluate HDMM on distributed data, and is secure in the context of a malicious aggregator and malicious clients (assuming an honest majority). Our preliminary empirical evaluation shows that Distributed HDMM can run on realistic datasets and workloads with thousands of clients in less than one minute.
